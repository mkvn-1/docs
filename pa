   requirements of that Act. For purposes of improving the understanding of the Manual, definitions of these
   words as used elsewhere in this Manual are set forth below.

   1. PCRB Data Card – PCRB Data Cards are issued by the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau.
      These data cards provide the risk name, location, PCRB file number, authorized classification(s) and if
      applicable the risk's experience modification for a minimum of one year.

      Risks approved for the Pennsylvania Construction Classification Premium Adjustment Program and
      any other applicable credit programs will be shown on these data cards.

   2. PCRB Loss Costs – Dollar amounts per unit of exposure attributable to the payment of losses under
      workers compensation and employers liability coverages, filed by the PCRB based on the aggregate
      experience of all PCRB members and approved by the Insurance Commissioner.

   3. PCRB Rating Values – All parameters filed by the PCRB and approved by the Insurance
      Commissioner, and which are used either mandatorily or by option of carriers for purposes of pricing
      workers compensation and employers liability coverages. Such PCRB rating values include PCRB
      Loss Costs, experience rating plan values such as Expected Loss Cost Factors, Credibility, Maximum
      Value of One Accident, and Credibility Weighted Maximum Value Charge, retrospective rating plan
      values such as the Table of Expected Loss Ranges, Excess Loss Pure Premium Factors,

5. Carrier Rating Values – All parameters used by carriers for purposes of pricing workers compensation and employers liability insurance coverages. Such parameters may be either PCRB Rating Values adopted by a carrier for its own use or values independently determined by a carrier.

6. Loss Cost – Dollar amounts per unit of exposure attributable to the payment of losses under workers compensation and employers liability coverages. Loss Costs may be developed either by the PCRB based on the aggregate experience of all PCRB members or may be established by individual carriers based on their own supporting information.

7. Provision for Claim Payment – Historical aggregate losses projected through development to their ultimate value and through trending to a future point in time, but excluding all loss adjustment or claim management expenses, other operating expenses, assessments, taxes and profit or contingency allowances. In this Manual the term "Loss Cost" is synonymous with Provision for Claim Payment.

8. Rating Value – A parameter or number used in pricing workers compensation or employers liability insurance coverages. Rating Values may be established by the PCRB or by individual carriers. Where individual carriers have established Rating Values different from those of the PCRB, the carrier's values supersede those of the PCRB for purposes of that insurer's policies.

9. Rating Effective Date (RED) is the earliest date that a specific experience rating or merit rating adjustment is applied to a policy.

The Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau shall hereinafter be referred to as the "PCRB".

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

## F. DEDUCTIBLE COVERAGE

The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, requires an insurer issuing a workers compensation policy to offer a deductible program upon a policyholder's request.

2. The claimants' benefits will be paid by the insurance carrier without regard to any deductible.

3. The policyholder must agree to reimburse the carrier for the deductible amount for any benefits paid to claimants.

4. Failure of the policyholder to reimburse the carrier for any deductible amount shall be treated as non-payment of premium under the policy.

Code 951, Salesperson – Outside, Code 953, Clerical Office Employees and Code 822, Telecommuting Clerical Employees, cannot be governing classifications unless they are the only classifications on the policy.

6. The premium adjustment for the deductible provisions of the policy shall be reported as a credit which shall be applied prior to experience modification or other carrier premium modifications.

7. If the policy is issued with a deductible provision, the Deductible Endorsement (WC 37 04 03) shall be issued and made part of the policy.

8. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department has promulgated three deductible coverage levels of $1,000 per claim, $5,000 per claim and $10,000 per claim respectively. Individual carriers can offer different deductible levels and/or premium credits upon approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.

## G. GROUP DEDUCTIBLE OR RETROSPECTIVE RATING PLAN COVERAGE

The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, permits an insurer issuing a workers compensation policy to offer an endorsement for deductible or retrospective rating plans for groups of five or more employers, subject to approval by the Insurance Commissioner and subject to the individual insurer's underwriting criteria for deductible coverage (see F. 1. above)

1. The insurer will issue an individual workers compensation policy for each member of the group

2. Each group member will be held jointly and severally liable for the payment of premiums or deductible amounts with regard to benefits paid for compensable claims of the group as a whole.

## RULE IV – CLASSIFICATIONS

### Item 4 of the Information Page

### A. GENERAL EXPLANATION

1. Objective

   The objective of the classification system is to group employers into classifications so that the rating
   value for each classification reflects the risk of loss common to those employers (See Rule IV, C. 2. & C.
   3.). Subject to certain exceptions described later in this rule, it is the business of the insured within
   Pennsylvania that is classified, not the separate employments, occupations or operations within the
   business.

### B. Classifications

Classifications are listed numerically in Section 2 (Classifications) of this Manual. The classification
description, if applicable, and Underwriting Guide entry immediately below a classification's title pertain to
that classification.

Each temporary staffing classification is a one-to one match with a direct employment classification.
Temporary staffing classifications are identified by a four-digit number that is 2000 greater than the
associated direct employment classification. For example, for direct employment classification
323, the corresponding temporary staffing classification is 2323.

1. Direct Employment Classifications

   All classifications in this Manual, other than the standard exception classifications and the
   temporary staffing classifications, are direct employment classifications. The direct employment
   classification description, if applicable, and Underwriting Guide entry immediately below a direct
   employment classification's title pertain to the classification. Direct employment classifications describe
   an employer's field of business as illustrated in the following examples:

   | INDUSTRY | EMPLOYER'S FIELD OF BUSINESS | DIRECT EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATION |
   |----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | Manufacturing | Wood Furniture Manufacturing | 323, Furniture Mfg. – Wood |
   | Process | Screen Printing | 281, Printing, N.O.C. |
   | Construction or Erection | Residential Carpentry | 652, Carpentry – Residential |
   | Service | Airport Operation | 7428, Airport Operation – Ground Employees |

2. Subclassifications – Carrier Option

   The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, permits an insurer to
   develop subclassifications to the PCRB's classification system as approved by the Insurance
   Commissioner. Any such subclassification shall be filed by the developing insurer with the PCRB and
   the Insurance Commissioner thirty (30) days prior to its use. The insurer's filing shall demonstrate that
   payroll and loss data produced under such subclassification can be reported to the PCRB consistent
   with the PCRB's classification system and statistical plan. Otherwise, the Insurance Commissioner shall
   disapprove the subclassification filing.

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

### 3. Temporary Staffing Classifications

A temporary staffing contractor hires employees and assigns those employees to an unrelated business for temporary work assignments varying in duration from one day to any period less than one year. Subject to specified exceptions, temporary staff provided by a temporary staffing contractor to a client shall be assigned to the temporary staffing classification corresponding to the client's assigned direct employment classification. Each temporary staffing classification is a one-to-one match with a direct employment classification. Temporary staffing classifications are identified by a four-digit number that is 2,000 greater than the associated direct employment classification. The corresponding temporary staffing classification for each direct employment classification, where applicable, is identified in the direct employment classification's entry in the Section 2 – Alphabetic Classification Underwriting Guide. Examples of temporary staffing classifications are shown below:

| DIRECT EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATION | CORRESPONDING TEMPORARY STAFFING CLASSIFICATION |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 323, Furniture Mfg. – Wood | 2323, Furniture Mfg. – Wood – Temporary Staffing |
| 281, Printing, N.O.C. | 2281, Printing, N.O.C. – Temporary Staffing |
| 652, Carpentry – Residential | 2652, Carpentry – Residential – Temporary Staffing |
| 7428, Airport Operation – Ground Employees | 9428, Airport Operation – Ground Employees – Temporary Staffing |

Refer to the Temporary Staffing Contractors entry in the General Auditing & Classification Information section of this Manual for additional details regarding the classification procedure for temporary staffing contractors.

### 4. Standard Exception Classification

Some occupations are common to so many businesses that special classifications have been established for them. They are called standard exception classifications. Employees within the definition of a standard exception classification are not included in a basic classification unless the basic classification specifically includes those employees. The standard exception classifications are defined below:

a. CLERICAL OFFICE EMPLOYEES – Code 953 – are employees exclusively engaged in keeping the books or records of the insured or conducting correspondence or who are engaged wholly in office work where such books or records are kept or such correspondence is conducted.

   This classification shall be applied only to employees herein described who work exclusively in separate buildings or on separate floors or in departments on such floors which are separated from all other workplaces of the employer by floor to ceiling partitions except for retail stores where a partition at least five feet high is required and within which no work is performed other than clerical office duties as defined in this rule.

   Office employees shall be separately classified except in connection with those classes which are designated "all employees including office."

   If any clerical office employee (including drafting employees) has any other regular duty, the entire payroll of that employee shall be assigned in accordance with the class to which the business is assigned.

If such records are not maintained, the employee is assigned to the classification applicable to their duties prior to any emergency orders, laws, or regulations issued due to the COVID–19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. Once normal business operations resume, appropriate classifications should be applied.

This exception is applicable for new, renewal and in-force policies effective on March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2023.

This exception does not apply to new or renewal policies with effective dates on or after July 1, 2023.

An employee who interchanges between performing clerical office work at the employer's place of business and performing clerical office work by telecommuting shall be assigned to Code 822 when more than 50% of the employee's time is spent telecommuting. Such employees shall be assigned to Code 953 when 50% or less of their time is spent telecommuting

c. SALESPERSONS – OUTSIDE, Code 951 – are employees either exclusively engaged in sales or collection work away from the employer's premises or who regularly and frequently (as defined in Section 2 of this Manual) are engaged in sales or collection work away from their employer's premises and devote the balance of their time to clerical office duties. Salespersons, collectors or messengers shall be separately classified except in connection with those classifications designated either "all employees including office" or "all employees except office.)

This classification does not apply to:

(1) Employees delivering merchandise or products. Even though such employees may also collect or solicit, they shall be assigned in accordance with the employer's applicable business classification.

C.     ASSIGNMENT OF CLASSIFICATIONS

1.     Object of the Classification Procedure

        a.     The object of the classification procedure is to assign the one basic classification which best
               describes each distinct business enterprise of the insured within Pennsylvania. Subject to certain
               exceptions described in this Rule, each classification includes all the various types of labor found
               in a distinct enterprise. It is the business which is classified, not the individual employments,
               occupations or operations within a business. Additional classifications shall be assigned as
               provided below.

        b.     The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, permits an insurer
               to develop sub classifications to the PCRB's classification system as approved by the Insurance
               Commissioner. Any such sub classification shall be filed by the developing insurer with the PCRB
               and the Insurance Commissioner thirty (30) days prior to its use. The insurer's filing shall
               demonstrate that payroll and loss data produced under such sub classification can be reported to
               the PCRB consistent with the PCRB's classification system and statistical plan. Otherwise, the
               Insurance Commissioner shall disapprove the sub classification filing.

2.   Assignment of a Classification

     a.   The policy shall contain only classifications approved by the Pennsylvania Compensation
          Rating Bureau and in accordance with this Manual.

          Each classification is presumed to describe an entire business enterprise. Any policy which
          contains more than a single classification cannot contain any classifications representing a payroll
          less than that of one full-time employee, but this rule will not apply in classifications involved in
          Construction, Erection, Stevedoring, Part-Time Aircraft Operations or if the business' basic
          and major operations are described by the Standard Exception Classifications and there are
          employees whose job duties are not assignable to the Standard Exceptions except as specified in
          classification phraseology.

     b.   Single Enterprise. If a risk consists of a single operation or a number of separate operations
          which normally occur in the business described by a single manual classification, or separate
          operations which are an integral part of or incidental to the main business, that single classification
          which most accurately describes the entire enterprise shall be applied. The separate operations so
          covered may not be assigned to another classification even though such operation may be
          specifically described by some other classification or may be conducted at a separate location.

          Division of payroll shall be made as provided in respect to General Exclusions, Standard
          Exceptions or Special Class Wording. For construction or erection work, see special procedure set
          forth in Rule IV, C. 5.

                                                EXCEPTION

          Where a retail outlet is located at the same or contiguous premises as a business' manufacturing
          facility, the applicable retail store classification shall apply to the payroll of the retail outlet provided
          that such outlet is operated in an area physically separate from other operations by a floor to
          ceiling partition and it is separately staffed.

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

c. Authorized Classifications. When the classification of any insured has been established by the PCRB, no policy shall be issued or endorsed nor adjustment of premium made under any other or conflicting classification.

   In any instance where the established classification does not describe the current operations of the insured, the insuring carrier or insured shall draw the matter to the attention of the PCRB in writing with full particulars prior to the application of any other classifications. The reclassification shall not take place until the PCRB Staff has received and reviewed such documentation and has replied in writing to the insured or insuring carrier agreeing with their position or otherwise advising on which class(es) to assign.

   The insuring carrier is not relieved of the obligation to apply the class authorized for an insured because of lack of knowledge that the PCRB has established an authorized classification for that insured.

3. Assignment of Additional Classifications

   a. Multiple Classifications/Multiple Enterprises (Not construction or erection operations – see paragraph 6.)

      Additional classifications may be used only when valid evidence supports their authorization or in conformity with the rules stated under "Standard Exceptions" and "Exclusions." Additional classes may not be added without PCRB authorization when their use is in violation of Manual Rules or an existing PCRB data card.

      Additional classifications shall be assigned to an insured only if the following conditions exist:

      (1) If the classification wording requires the assignment of an additional classification for specified employees or operations.
      (2) If there are distinct enterprises (meaning thereby businesses, which are specifically classified in this Manual, but not operations that normally occur in the business described by the assigned classifications, nor operations described by any of the General Inclusions), conducted in a given plant by the same insured and the entire work in each enterprise is conducted either in a separate building or on a separate floor or floors of a building, or on the same floor in separate departments divided by floor to ceiling partitions without interchange of labor and the insured conducts each of such enterprises as a separate undertaking with separate records of payroll, then such separate undertakings shall each be separately classified, (and the proper carrier rating value applied to each).
      (3) See Governing Classification rules for assignment of incidental operations that support more than one distinct enterprise.

   b. Governing Classification

      The governing classification is that classification other than the standard exception classifications (which may never be the governing class) which carries the largest amount of payroll exclusive of payroll of miscellaneous employees as defined below.

      (1) This concept shall be utilized not in the initial classification assignment process but to determine how to classify miscellaneous employees when an insured is assigned two or more classifications.
      (2) Miscellaneous employees are employees that either supervise or support all the various undertakings of the insured. The functions performed by miscellaneous employees may include but are not necessarily limited to: maintenance, mailroom, shipping and receiving, yard operations, security, power plant operations, lobby or front desk personnel, elevator operators, porters, foremen, superintendents or timekeepers.

Page 34
UNDERWRITING RULES

(3) The entire remuneration of miscellaneous employees is assignable to the governing
classification.
(4) The governing classification in the case of construction or erection operations shall be
determined on a job basis within each policy period if payrolls are kept separately by job
within the policy period; otherwise on the basis of the entire policy period.
(5) If the basic and major operations are described by classifications defined as Standard
Exceptions, the payroll of all employees not specifically included in the definition for such
Standard Exceptions shall be separately classified to Code 971.

## 4. Assignment By Analogy

Any enterprise which is not described by a classification in this Manual shall be assigned to the
classification or classifications most analogous from the standpoint of process and hazard. The
limitations and conditions of the classification or classifications so assigned and all Manual rules
pertaining to the classification shall be applicable.

## 5. Payroll Assignment – Multiple Classifications - Interchange of Labor

Some employees who are not miscellaneous employees may perform duties directly related to more
than one classification. When there is such an interchange of labor, the entire payroll of employees who
interchange shall be assigned to the insuring carrier's highest-valued classification representing any part
of their work.

The payroll of one employee shall not be divided into two or more classes except where specifically
described in classification wording as "to be separately rated" or "separately rate" and with no
requirement for separate staff. See the paragraph immediately below for the auditing procedure.

### General Exceptions to C. 5. above

For Construction, Erection, Temporary Staffing or Stevedoring, the payroll of any individual employee
may be divided and allocated to more than one such classification provided the entry on the original
records of the insured discloses an allocation of each such individual employee's payroll. Estimated or
percentage allocation of payroll is not permitted. Only a single stevedoring class shall be applied to all
payroll developed in the loading or unloading of a single vessel. For further reference see the material
under Stevedoring in Section 2 of the Manual. For Executive Officers see Rule IX, A. 4.

## 6. Construction or Erection Operations

Each distinct type of construction or erection operation at a job or location shall be assigned to the
classification which specifically describes such operation provided separate payroll records are
maintained for each operation. Estimated or percentage allocation of payroll is not permitted.

Any such operation for which separate payroll records are not maintained shall be assigned to the
insuring carrier's highest-valued classification which applies to the job or location where the operation is
performed.

A separate construction or erection classification shall not be assigned to any operation which is within
the scope of another classification assigned to such a job or location which is assignable to a
construction classification designated "all work to completion." All operations of the insured contractor
at that job or location shall be assignable to such classification.

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

8. Changing Classifications

a. The PCRB is empowered to determine, revise or modify the classification(s) assigned to any individual insured. No written application by the carrier, agent of record or an insured to change an insured's authorized classification(s) shall be considered by the PCRB until the carrier has issued and filed a copy of its policy Information Page written in accordance with an insured's authorized classification(s). The classification(s) shown in any policy shall be subject to correction or modification, or both, if the PCRB finds by survey or otherwise that the classification(s) shown in the policy are inappropriate to the insured. No written application to change the classification(s) for an insured on the grounds that the insured has been improperly classified shall be considered by the PCRB unless such written application is filed directly with the PCRB by the insured, agent of record or the carrier during the policy period with respect to which the application is made, or within twelve months after the termination thereof.

   (1) A change in an insured's classification that results from a recent change in an insured's operations (i.e. an operations change that has taken place during the current policy year or the policy year that has just expired) will be applied pro rata as of the date of the change in the insured's operations, regardless of the premium impact to the insured. When a PCRB review discloses the insured's recent operations change, the PCRB will make written notice to the carrier of record changing the insured's authorized classification(s) for the current policy

   (2) A correction of a misclassification which results in a premium decrease shall be applied to the insured's policy in effect when the application for correction is made and to the prior policy within twelve months after the termination thereof.

   (3) A correction of a misclassification which results in a premium increase shall be applied to the employer's first policy effective at least sixty days subsequent to the date of the PCRB's misclassification notice.

   (4) When the temporary interruption or suspension of normal business activities caused by COVID–19 results in a change in business operations, an employer may be temporarily reassigned to an alternate classification if separate, accurate, verifiable records are maintained. If such records are not maintained, the operations are assigned to the classification applicable to the business prior to any emergency orders, laws, or regulations issued due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. Once normal business operations resume, appropriate classifications should be applied.

   This exception is applicable for new, renewal, and in-force policies effective on March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2023. This exception does not apply to new or renewal policies with effective dates on or after July 1, 2023.

b. Any correction of a misclassification arising from discovery by the carrier of a material misrepresentation or intentional omission by the insured, its agent, employees, officers or directors shall be applied effective the date upon which it would have applied had such material misrepresentation or intentional omission not been made. It is recommended that a carrier claiming material misrepresentation or intentional omission as contemplated in this Rule secure a declaratory judgment from the Common Pleas Court establishing same prior to proceeding with application of this Rule.

c. The reallocation of payroll by a carrier among an insured's authorized classifications or the PCRB requiring a carrier to reallocate payroll among an insured's authorized classifications or to report payroll under an insured's authorized classifications for an insured's current policy or for the insured's prior policy within twelve months after the termination thereof does not constitute a class change or correction.

d. Any reclassification pursuant to a revision in classification procedure that PCRB has filed with and
   that has been approved by the Insurance Commissioner shall be effective only upon any insured's
   first policy effective on or after the effective date for the revision approved by the Insurance
   Commissioner.

9. Carrier Determinations of Employment Status

   A carrier's determination of a person's employment status (including but not necessarily limited to
   questions regarding a person's designation as an employee, independent contractor, uninsured
   subcontractor, leased employee or temporary staff) is not subject to the PCRB's review or approval.
   Where a carrier's determination of a person's employment status results in a request for authorization
   of a different or additional classification(s), such request must be made in writing. The PCRB will
   determine the applicability of any requested classification(s) in accordance with the classification
   guidelines set forth in this Manual. Classifications so approved by the PCRB shall be applied to any
   policy to which the carrier's determination of the person's employment status applies, if such policy
   expired or was terminated not more than 12 months before the date on which the PCRB received the
   carrier's written request.

   This rule for determining the policy(ies) to which the approved classification(s) shall be assigned will
   apply regardless of whether the authorization of the classification(s) increases or decreases premium
   for the affected policy(ies). This rule shall govern in the event this rule conflicts with any other rule in
   this Manual.

10. Classification Appeals

    The PCRB's assignment of an individual employer to a particular classification may be appealed
    pursuant to Rule XVI, APPEALS FROM APPLICATION OF THE RATING SYSTEM PROCEDURE,
    Section 1 of this Manual.

11. Mercantile Businesses/Stores

    Where a store or dealer sells several types of merchandise, each of which may be subject to a different
    classification, such store or dealer shall be assigned on the basis of the principal category of
    merchandise sold. For mercantile businesses, such as stores or dealers, the single applicable store or
    dealer classification is determined separately for each location.

D. SHOW THE CLASSIFICATIONS IN ITEM 4 OF THE INFORMATION PAGE

   Show the proper classification wording, with or without notes, and show the code number in Item 4 of the
   Information Page. Capitalized classification wording may be used instead of the entire wording. Section 2 of

F.    BASIS OF PREMIUM - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1.     Employee Expense Reimbursements

       Reimbursement expenses (except for hand or power tools as provided for in Rule V., B. 2. i.) paid to
       employees may be excluded from the audit provided that all three of the following conditions are met:

       a.     The reimbursed expenses paid were incurred upon the business of the employer, and;

       b.     The amount of each employee's expense payment is shown separately in the records of the
              employer, and;

       c.     The amount of each expense reimbursement reflects the actual expenses incurred by the
              employee in the conduct of his or her work.

2.     Salary Reduction Plans

       In determining the remuneration to be used for premium computation purposes, no deduction shall be
       permitted for contributions to employee benefit plans made by employees either directly or through
       salary reduction agreements. The typical salary reduction plan involves a binding salary reduction
       agreement through which a specific percentage of the employee's salary is not paid to him or her but is
       paid into a pension, medical or savings plan (Section 125 IRC).

3.     Strike Periods (Wages Paid)

       Wages paid to employees who are not on strike but who are unable to perform their normal duties
       because of a strike shall be assigned to the classification applicable to the work usually performed by
       such employees, except that if any such employees perform absolutely no work for their employer and
       are not present on their employer's premises during such period, such wages shall be assigned to Code
       953, Clerical Office Employees, provided the facts are clearly disclosed by the employer's records.

4.     Traveling Time Payments

       Payments made by an employer to an employee to reimburse him or her for time spent in traveling to or
       from work or to or from a specific job shall be considered as remuneration in accordance with the
       provisions of Rule V., B. of the Manual, and such remuneration shall be assigned to the Manual
       classification which applies to the work normally performed by such employee.

5.     Wages Paid for Idle Time
       Idle time is downtime that occurs when employees are not working and the employer pays the
       employees for the time not worked. Idle time does not include "paid furloughed employees" or
       "payments to paid furloughed employees" as defined in Rule V.F.10.

       a.      The entire amount of wages paid for idle time shall be included as payroll.

       b.      Wages paid for idle time due to the following causes shall be assigned in their entirety to the
               classification which applies to the work normally performed by the employee involved:

               1.      Suspension or delay of work on account of weather conditions.
               2.      Delays while waiting for materials.
               3.      Delays while waiting for another contractor to complete certain work.
               4.      Delays arising from breakdown of equipment.
               5.      "Stand-by" time where employees such as operators of cranes, hoists or other equipment
                       are on the job but their active services are not required continuously.

6. Special union requirements or agreements between employer and employees calling for
   pay for idle time under specified circumstances.
7. Other cause of similar nature.

c. Wages paid to key employees of construction, erection or stevedoring risks, such as
   superintendents, foremen or engineers, for periods during which no jobs are in progress, shall be
   assigned to the classification applicable to the work which each one normally performs.
   (Exception: Reference Strike Periods – Wages Paid.)

d. The entire amount of wages paid for idle time to an employee engaged in work other than
   construction, erection or stevedoring must be assigned without division to the classification which
   normally applied to that employee.

6. Religious Exclusions (Members of certain religious sects whose tenets prohibit benefits from
   insurance provided the sect makes provisions for its members).

   Workers' compensation insurance is not compulsory for the above individuals. As per Section
   304.2(a) "An employer may file an application with the Department of Labor and Industry to be excepted
   from the provisions of this Act in respect to certain employees. The application shall include a written
   waiver by the employee of all benefits under the Act and an affidavit by the employee that he is a
   member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof and is an adherent of established tenets or
   teachings of such sect or division by reason of which he is conscientiously opposed to the acceptance of
   the benefits of any public or private insurance which makes payments in the event of death, disability..."
   Documentation to support the above election must be in evidence at time of audit. Payroll to the above
   will then be excluded for purposes of premium determination.

7. Members of Religious Orders

   Refer to Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Manual. In Pennsylvania, because of
   the interest of some of the Catholic dioceses in providing coverage for members of orders on a voluntary
   basis, specific underwriting procedures as well as per capita rates were adopted by the PCRB.

   When such individual is assigned to perform duties in churches, hospitals, schools or other institutions,
   those institutions may wish to provide coverage as well. Any remuneration paid to the order on behalf of
   its members would be excluded, and the appropriate per capita rates would be applied.

8. Subcontractors (Applicable Contracting Classifications)

   Consideration has been given to questions which have arisen regarding the classification procedure for
   a subcontractor who performs a single type of work on a contracting project or job. This situation is
   illustrated by Code 603, Sewer Construction, where portions of the work such as excavation may be
   subcontracted.

   Consistent with the classification treatment which has been generally observed, it has been ruled that
   such subcontracted work shall be classified on the basis of the classification describing the particular
   type of work involved. Thus, the subcontractor who only performs excavation work in connection with
   the construction of a sewer would be classified as Code 609, Excavation, rather than as Code 603,
   Sewer Construction.

   The ruling in connection with concrete construction has been continued. This requires that all operations
   including making and erecting forms, placing reinforcing steel and stripping forms, when done by
   subcontractors, shall be assigned to the appropriate concrete construction classification.

Page 43                                                                                                  UNDERWRITING RULES

These rulings apply only to insured subcontractors. Uninsured subcontractors, covered under the principal contractor's policy, will continue to be classified on the basis of the classifications which would apply if the work were performed by the principal's own employees.

## 9. Outworkers/Homeworkers

Under Section 104 of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act an employee is defined as "All natural persons who perform services for another for a valuable consideration exclusive of persons to whom articles or materials are given out to be made up, cleaned, washed, altered, ornamented, finished or repaired, or adapted for sale in the workers' own home, or on other premises, not under the control or management of the employer."

A review of the relevant case law by the PCRB counsel indicated the definition of an "employee" is not of significance in disputes over the coverage status for individuals who are injured while working in the home. Instead, the focus is on whether the injury occurred in the furtherance of the business of the employer. Therefore, the ability to resolve disputes involving coverage status for an outworker/homeworker, as defined in the Act, remains a legal question beyond the PCRB's authority. Accordingly, the employee status of an outworker/homeworker is left to the discretion of the individual insurance carrier.

## 10. Payments to Paid Furloughed Employees During Federal, State, and/or Local Emergency Orders, Laws, or Regulations Issued Due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic

a. For purposes of this, "paid furloughed employees" and "payments to paid furloughed employees" are defined within this rule. "Paid furloughed employees" means employees who continue to receive payments during a temporary layoff or an involuntary leave and are not performing any work duties for an employer.

b. "Payments to paid furloughed employees" means payments made by an employer or any public Governmental entity to paid furloughed employees as a result of federal, state, and/or local emergency orders, laws or regulations, issued due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic which impact an employer's staffing or business operations. Such payments do not include any appropriated funds or loans received by an employer as authorized by any law or regulation, or public governmental entity, that are used by an employer specifically to retain or hire working employees.

c. Payments to paid furloughed employees must be assigned to Code 1212, in accordance with the Statistical Plan. Payments to paid furloughed employees made in accordance with this Rule V.F.10 are excluded from the premium, experience rating and merit rating calculations only if the employer keeps separate, accurate, and verifiable records. If separate, accurate, and verifiable records are not maintained, payroll is assigned to the classification for work normally performed by the employee prior to any emergency orders, laws, or regulations issued due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

d. If an employee is requested to perform any duties for an employer, the employee is not deemed a paid furloughed employee for any period of time they are performing duties for the employer. If the employee is not deemed a paid furloughed employee, payroll must be assigned to the classification applicable to the work being performed in accordance with Manual Rule IV.A.1.

e. Rule V.F.10 is applicable to new, renewal and in-force policies effective on March 1, 2020 through June 30, 2023. Rule V.F.10 does not apply to new or renewal policies with effective dates on or after July 1, 2023.

## RULE VI – RATING VALUES AND PREMIUM DETERMINATION

### A. PCRB RATING VALUES

1. PCRB Loss Cost

   PCRB Loss Costs – Dollar amounts per unit of exposure attributable to the payment of losses under
   workers compensation and employers liability coverages, filed by the PCRB based on the aggregate
   experience of all PCRB members and approved by the Insurance Commissioner.

2. Disease Or Radiation Loading

   a. A supplemental disease loading (e.g. Code 0066) may apply to certain basic classifications (e.g.
      Code 447). The supplemental disease loading is an additional charge. It is not included within the
      rating value of the basic classification to which it is assigned. Once authorized, a supplemental
      disease loading may only be removed upon approval of the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating
      Bureau.

   b. The Loss Costs applicable to the basic classifications without a corresponding supplemental
      disease loading include the usual exposure to diseases associated with those classifications.

   c. A supplemental occupational disease or radiation loading may be applied to the carrier rate for any
      individual business where the occupational disease or radiation hazard is abnormal, subject to
      approval by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner. When a carrier plans to apply for the
      supplemental loading, the carrier shall supply the PCRB with an inspection report either by an
      insurance carrier, Department of Labor and Industry or an outside source which supports the
      abnormal disease or radiation exposure. The carrier shall also recommend a value for the
      supplemental loading. The request and supporting documentation shall be forwarded by the PCRB
      to the Insurance Commissioner. Upon approval by the Insurance Commissioner, the supplemental
      loading shall be published by the PCRB on the business' PCRB data card for a minimum of one
      year. The supplemental loading may be removed only by an inspection report performed by an
      insurance company, Department of Labor and Industry or another agency evidencing the
      abnormal exposure no longer exists. The PCRB shall also forward this request and documentation
      to the Insurance Commissioner for review and action. The supplemental disease or radiation
      loading is non-ratable in the experience and retrospective rating plans. No supplemental
      occupational disease or radiation loading shall be used absent explicit approval from the Insurance
      Commissioner.

3. Premium Adjustment Factor

4. Experience Rating Factor

5. Terrorism

   Premium for Terrorism is calculated on the basis of total payroll according to Rule V. The premium
   charge is calculated by dividing a risk's total payroll by $100 and multiplying the result times the carrier's
   rating value. This premium is applied after standard premium and is not subject to any other
   modifications, including, but not limited to, premium discount, experience rating, merit rating, schedule
   rating, or retrospective rating. Non-Payroll exposures are not subject to premium charges for Terrorism.
   Policies issued on an "If Any" basis will not be charged this premium, unless premium develops during
   the policy term or at audit. Per capita charges are not subject to premium for Terrorism.

   Terrorism shall be separately stated on the Standard Policy and shall be designated to Code 9740.

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

6. Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism)

Premium for Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism) is calculated on the basis of total payroll according to Rule V. The premium charge is calculated by dividing a risk's total payroll by $100 and multiplying the result times the carrier's rating value. This premium is applied after standard premium and is not subject to any other modifications, including, but not limited to, premium discount, experience rating, merit rating, schedule rating, or retrospective rating. Non- payroll exposures are not subject to premium charges for Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism). Policies issued on an "If Any" basis will not be charged this premium, unless premium develops during the policy term or at audit. Per capita charges are not subject to premium for Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism).

Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism) shall be separately stated on the Standard Policy and shall be designated to Statistical Code 9741.

7. Employer Assessments Pursuant to Act 57 of 1997

Act 57 of 1997 requires that "... the assessments for the maintenance of the Subsequent Injury Fund, the Workmen's Compensation Supersede as Fund and the Workmen's Compensation Administration Fund under sections 306.2, 443 and 446 of the act of June 2, 1915 (P.L. 736, No. 338), known as the "Workers' Compensation Act, shall no longer be imposed on insurers but shall be imposed, collected and remitted through insurers in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor and Industry."

In compliance with the above referenced provisions of Act 57 of 1997, the insurance carrier issuing any Standard Policy providing workers compensation insurance other than Coal Mine under the Workers' Compensation Act in Pennsylvania shall impose on and collect from the employer/entity insured thereunder an Employer Assessment computed according to the following formula:

Employer Assessment equals Act 57 of 1997 Employer Assessment Factor times Employer Assessment Premium Base.

The Employer Assessment shall be computed, imposed and collected consistent with the following definitions of terms:

Act 57 of 1997 Employer Assessment Factor - a factor expressed to four decimal places proposed by the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau and approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner for the specific purpose of computing employer assessments in conformance with Act 57 of 1997.

Employer Assessment Premium Base - Calculation of Employer Assessment Premium Base proceeds by adding back to the total policy premium the amount of any applicable Small Deductible Premium Credit or Large Deductible Premium Credit. Small or Large Deductible Premium Credits include either of the following statistical codes in Pennsylvania:

9663
9664

Employer Assessments imposed, collected and remitted pursuant to Act 57 of 1997 shall be separately stated on the Standard Policy and shall be designated by Statistical Code 0938.

For reference purposes, two examples of the intended determination of the appropriate Employer Assessment Base consistent with this rule are shown below. The first example presents a risk for which a deductible credit applies before experience modification. The second example presents a risk for which a deductible credit applies after experience modification.

## B. CARRIER RATING VALUES

### 1. Expense Constant

Expense Constant (if any) is determined by individual carriers' rating values. It applies to every policy
and it covers expenses such as those for issuing, recording and auditing, which are common to all
workers compensation policies regardless of size.

### 2. Minimum Premium

Minimum Premium (if any) is determined by individual carriers' rating values. It is an expression of the
lowest premium amount for which a single risk can be written and carried for any period of time.

### 3. Premium Discount

Premium Discount (if any) is determined by individual carriers' rating values. It recognizes that the
relative expense of issuing and servicing larger premium policies is less than for smaller policies.

### 4. Retrospective Rating Factor

## C. PREMIUM

Premium for each classification shown on the policy is determined by multiplying the basis of premium by the
carrier rate dividing by 100.

Pennsylvania and Delaware Premium Algorithm Preface:

The computation of workers compensation premium includes a broad complement of potential rating values,
pricing programs and other similar or related variables. To the extent that these component parts of premium
determination may be applied in a prescribed sequence and using defined formulas and/or relationships,
several potential benefits arise including the following:

- Competitive differences within the marketplace can be more clearly defined and consistently applied;
- Similarly situated risks can receive comparable treatment with respect to specific rating values, pricing
  programs or other factors, increasing the equity of the marketplace;
- Analysis of the effects of various components of overall premium determination can be better
  understood and more intelligently compared across carriers, states and/or time;
- In the event that new pricing programs or other factors are introduced in the future, the defined
  existing formulas can provide a consistent basis for the development of programs and system
  procedures within the workers compensation industry.

# RULE VII – PREMIUM DISCOUNT

Item 4 of the Information Page.

## A. PREMIUM DISCOUNT

Premium Discount (if any) is determined by an individual carriers' rating values. It recognizes that the relative expense of issuing and servicing larger premium policies is less than for smaller premium policies.

## B. COMBINATION OF POLICIES

### 1. Combination Permitted

Two or more policies issued to the same insured by one or more insurance carriers under the same management may be combined for the purpose of computing the premium discount for that insured.

### 2. Combination Procedure

If such separate policies have different expiration dates, the combination for the purpose of 1. above is subject to the following:

a. The PCRB shall determine the effective date for the application of premium discount.

b. All such policies in force prior to such effective date shall be cancelled and rewritten as of the effective date.

c. All policies effective after the effective date of the combination shall be written to expire concurrently with other policies in the combination.

## C. WRAP-UP LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

The first step in setting up a "wrap-up" program requires the carrier to request approval from:
Compensation Actuary, Bureau of Regulation of Rates and Policies, Pennsylvania Insurance
Department, 1311 Strawberry Square, Harrisburg, PA 17120.

The following application of the premium discount is optional for wrap up construction projects which are not under a retrospective rating plan:

Policies issued to two or more legal entities engaged in a construction, erection or demolition project may be combined for the purpose of computing premium discount, subject to the following conditions:

### 1. Insurance Carrier

All such policies must be issued by one or more insurance carriers under the same management.

### 2. Policy Limitation

The policies shall be limited to insurance on such large construction projects.

### 3. Eligible Entities

Entities eligible for combination shall be limited to the general contractor (including any owner or principal acting as a general contractor) and subcontractors performing work under contracts let on an ex-insurance basis. In addition, if the contract between the owner or principal and such general contractor is on an ex-insurance basis, the owner or principal shall be an eligible entity under this rule.

4. Carrier Coverage Responsibility

The carrier's coverage responsibility in a wrap-up project is for the duration of that project. Cancellation of such coverage is prohibited except for non-payment of premium.

5. PCRB Notification

The PCRB must be notified of the method by which the wrap-up policies will be identified.

6. Separate Policy Requirement

A separate policy is required for each entity included in the wrap-up plan and each policy is subject to that entity's own experience rating modification.

7. Experience Modifications

The experience developed by each entity in the combinations will be used in calculating the future experience modifications for the entity. There will be no experience rating for the project as a unit.

c. (1) Prior to issuing a building permit to a contractor, a municipality shall require the contractor
       to present proof of workers' compensation insurance or an affidavit that the contractor
       does not employ other individuals and is not required to carry workers' compensation
       insurance.

   (2) Every building permit issued by a municipality to a contractor shall clearly set forth the
       name and workers' compensation policy and the contractor's Federal or State Employer
       Identification Number. This information shall be in addition to any information required by
       municipal ordinance. If the building permit is issued to an applicant which affirms it is not
       obligated to maintain workers' compensation insurance under this act, the permit shall
       clearly set forth the contractor's Federal or State Employer Identification Number and the
       substance of the affirmation and that the applicant is not permitted to employ any individual
       to perform work pursuant to the building permit.

   (3) Every municipality issuing a building permit shall be named as a workers' compensation
       policy certificate holder of a contractor-issued building permit. This certificate shall be filed
       with the municipality's copy of the building permit. An insurer issuing a policy which names
       a municipality as a workers' compensation policy certificate holder pursuant to this section
       shall be required to notify that municipality of the expiration or cancellation of any such
       policy of insurance or policy certificate within three working days of such cancellation or
       expiration.

   (4) A municipality shall issue a stop-work order to a contractor who is performing work
       pursuant to a building permit, upon receiving actual notice that the contractor's workers'
       compensation insurance or State- approved self-insured status has been cancelled. Also, if
       the municipality receives actual notice that a permittee, having filed an affidavit of
       exemption from workers' compensation insurance, has hired persons to perform work
       pursuant to a building permit and does not maintain required workers' compensation
       insurance, the municipality shall issue a stop-work order. This order shall remain in effect
       until proper workers' compensation coverage is obtained for all work performed pursuant to
       the building permit.

d. (1) Where a contractor is performing work for a public body or political subdivision, all
       contractors and subcontractors shall provide proof of workers' compensation insurance to
       the public body or political subdivision effective for the duration of the work.

   (2) The public body or political subdivision shall issue a stop work order to any contractor who
       is performing work for that public body or political subdivision upon receiving notice that
       any public contractor's workers' compensation insurance, or State-approved self-insurance
       status, has expired or has been cancelled. If the public body or political subdivision
       receives actual notice that a contractor, having filed an affidavit of exemption from
       workers' compensation insurance, has hired persons to perform work for a public body or
       political subdivision and does not maintain the required workers' compensation insurance
       or self- insurance, the public body or political subdivision shall issue a stop work order,
       which order shall remain in effect until proper workers' compensation coverage is
       obtained for all work performed pursuant to the contract of work for the public body or
       political subdivision.

e. Should such policy of workers' compensation insurance be cancelled or expire during the
   duration of the work or should the workers' compensation self-insurance status change during
   the said period, the contractor shall immediately notify, in writing, the municipality, public body or
   political subdivision of such cancellation, expiration or change in status.

f. Nothing in this act shall be the basis of any liability on part of the municipality.

g. For purposes of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, "proof of insurance" shall include a
   certificate of insurance or self-insurance, demonstrating current coverage and compliance with
   the requirements of this act, the Occupational Disease Act and the Longshore and Harbor
   Workers' Compensation Act (44 Stat. 1424, 33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.), its amendments and
   supplements, where applicable.

h. For purposes of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of this section, "proof of insurance" shall not be
   required when the employer has been exempted pursuant to section 304.2 of this act.

2. Coverage

If the contractor has specifically assumed this liability, use the Statutory Employer Endorsement (WC 37 03
09) in Section 3 of this Manual. The carrier for the subcontractor should use Exclusion of Employees
Endorsement (WC 37 03 03) in Section 3 of this Manual.

3. Premium for Uninsured Subcontractors

The contractor shall furnish satisfactory evidence that the subcontractor had workers' compensation
insurance in force covering the work performed for the contractor. For each subcontractor for which such
evidence is not furnished, additional premium shall be charged on the policy which insured the contractor as
follows:

a. The contractor shall provide a complete payroll record of the employees of each uninsured
   subcontractor. Premium on such payroll shall be based on the classifications which would have
   applied if the employees of the subcontractor had been employees of the contractor.

b. If the contractor does not supply the payroll records of its subcontractor, the full subcontract price
   of the work performed during the policy period by the subcontractor shall be established as the
   payroll of the subcontractor's employees. The additional premium shall be charged on that
   amount as payroll.

   Exception to 3b

   If investigation on a specific job discloses that a definite amount of the subcontract price
   represents payroll, such amount shall be the payroll for the additional premium computation. In
   contracts for: (1) mobile equipment with operators (such as but not limited to: earth movers,
   graders, bulldozers, or log skidders), the payroll shall not be less than 33% of the subcontract
   price, (2) labor and material, the payroll shall not be less than 50% of the subcontract price, (3)
   labor only, the payroll shall be established as not less than 90% of the subcontract price.

c. If an experience modification has been established for the contractor, such experience
   modification shall be applied to the premium developed for the uninsured subcontractor.

4. Drivers, Chauffeurs and Helpers Under Contract

This rule on subcontractors does not apply to contracts to drivers, chauffeurs or helpers on vehicles
engaged under contract. See Rule IV B. 3a (10).

F. EX-MEDICAL COVERAGE

G. TRUCKERS - INTERSTATE

The payroll of a trucker shall be assigned to a state in which it has a terminal or base of operations. These guidelines are not applicable to dispatching or broker operations.

Example:

A driver/employee resides in State A. His employer/trucker base of operations is in State B. If the driver/employee regularly travels to the terminal or base of operations in State B to load or unload freight or perform other regular work functions, i.e. mechanic, the driver/employee payroll shall be assigned to State B.

When the trucker does not operate from a terminal or base of operation, the state to which the payroll is assigned shall be determined in accordance with the following procedures.

If it can be established that the trucker does a significant portion of its business in a single state, the payrolls, other than those payrolls which can be attributed to specific work functions in a specific state, should be assigned to that state. Factors such as driving time, number of pickups and deliveries, revenue and tonnage, should be considered in determining the state of payroll assignment. If a state payroll assignment cannot be made based on these factors, then the truckers payroll shall be assigned to his state of residence.

For the purposes of the guidelines the following definitions shall apply:

TRUCKER – A trucker is the holder of operating authority from a government agency.

TERMINAL OR BASE OF OPERATIONS – A permanent location owned, leased or used by the trucker at which loading, unloading and other related non-clerical work functions such as maintenance and transfers are performed and from which the driver/employee is assigned to work from on a regular basis.

STATE OF RESIDENCE – The state in which the trucker resides as evidenced by the location used for the filing of federal income taxes.

REGULAR – A pattern of 40 hours per week or any other pattern that appears on a continuing basis.

H. PENNSYLVANIA CONSTRUCTION CLASSIFICATION PREMIUM ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM

1. The Pennsylvania Construction Classification Premium Adjustment Program (PCCPAP) provides for a premium credit for up to one year for a policy which contains one or more construction classifications.

   For policies subject both to a Pennsylvania Construction Classification Premium Adjustment Program credit and any retrospective rating plan the PCCPAP credit shall be applied in determining standard premium. Such adjusted standard premium shall then be used wherever standard premium would otherwise apply in determining retrospective rating plan values and amounts for the retrospective rating plan applicable to the same risk if no PCCPAP credit were applicable. PCCPAP credits shall not be applied to final retrospective premium either in lieu of or in addition to the above prescribed procedure.

PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS COMPENSATION MANUAL
Effective: July 1, 2023
Page 63

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

The basis for determining the credit is the total payroll (including overtime premium pay) and hours worked for each construction classification as reported to taxing authorities. The applicable report periods vary according to the policy effective date of each policy, as set forth below:

| Policy Effective Dates | Reporting Period for Qualifying Wages |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| October 1, 2022 and later | Third calendar quarter of 2021 |

If the insured did not engage in operations for the complete quarter, then the last complete quarter prior to policy year inception shall be used or, if there was no complete quarter of operations prior to the policy inception, then the first complete quarter after policy inception shall be used. A credit may be determined for each construction classification by dividing the total payroll, including overtime premium pay, by the number of hours worked to arrive at the average hourly wage for the classification. In the absence of specific records for salaried employees, it will be assumed each such individual worked forty (40) hours per week. The credit for average hourly wage is listed below:

Policy Effective Dates – October 1, 2022 and later

| Average Hourly Wage | Credit From Standard Premium | Average Hourly Wage | Credit From Standard Premium |
|---------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| 35.94 or less | None | 44.65 - 45.44 | 18% |
| 35.95 - 36.49 | 5% | 45.45 - 46.29 | 19% |
| 36.50 - 37.09 | 6% | 46.30 - 47.14 | 20% |
| 37.10 - 37.69 | 7% | 47.15 - 47.99 | 21% |
| 37.70 - 38.34 | 8% | 48.00 - 48.89 | 22% |
| 38.35 - 38.99 | 9% | 48.90 - 49.79 | 23% |
| 39.00 - 39.64 | 10% | 49.80 - 50.74 | 24% |
| 39.65 - 40.29 | 11% | 50.75 - 51.69 | 25% |
| 40.30 - 40.99 | 12% | 51.70 - 52.69 | 26% |
| 41.00 - 41.69 | 13% | 52.70 - 53.69 | 27% |
| 41.70 - 42.39 | 14% | 53.70 - 54.74 | 28% |
| 42.40 - 43.14 | 15% | 54.75 - 55.84 | 29% |
| 43.15 - 43.89 | 16% | 55.85 and over | 30% |
| 43.90 - 44.64 | 17% | | |

The total construction classification credit amount, in dollars, must be calculated and then divided by the total policy premium at PCRB rating values – including construction and non-construction classifications. The resulting percentage credit will be the indicated policy credit. When calculating the indicated policy credit, the percentage shall be rounded to the nearest whole number with .5 being rounded upward (as an example, 5.4 rounded to 5 and 5.5 rounded to 6).

The indicated policy credit will be applied to the policy for any insured not eligible for experience rating. For insureds eligible for experience rating, a policy credit is determined as follows:

• The insured's experience modification effective one year prior to the effective date of the Pennsylvania Construction Classification Premium Adjustment Program (PCCPAP) credit will be determined in accordance with applicable Manual rules using expected losses reduced by the indicated policy credit percentage for the policy period to which the PCCPAP credit will apply. This experience modification will be designated as the PCCPAP numerator.

• The insured's experience modification effective one year prior to the effective date of the PCCPAP credit will be determined in accordance with applicable Manual rules. This experience modification will be designated as the PCCPAP denominator.

• A credit Adjustment Factor will be computed by dividing the PCCPAP numerator by the PCCPAP denominator. This credit adjustment factor will be rounded to four decimal places. In the event that the insured's experience modification factor effective one year prior to the effective date of the PCCPAP credit cannot be promulgated at the time the PCCPAP credit is determined, the credit adjustment factor will be set equal to 1.0000.

• A policy credit will be computed according to the following formula: 100 - [100 - indicated policy credit] x credit adjustment factor

• The policy credit, rounded to the nearest whole number using the convention described above with respect to the indicated policy credit, will be applied to the policy for insureds eligible for experience rating.

EXAMPLE:

Hypothetical insured qualified for experience rating –

| | |
|---|---|
| 1. | Insured's indicated policy credit: | 26 |
| 2. | PCCPAP numerator: (insured's experience modification for prior policy period with expected losses reduced by the indicated policy credit) | 1.026 |
| 3. | PCCPAP denominator: (insured's experience modification for prior policy period) | 0.957 |
| 4. | Credit adjustment factor: ((2) / (3)) rounded to 4 decimals | 1.0721 |
| 5. | Policy credit factor: 100 - [100 - 26] x 1.0721 rounded to two decimals | 21 |

The insured shall submit the required payroll and hours worked information to the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau for calculation of any applicable credit. The carrier shall, upon audit, verify the information that was submitted by the insured and used in the calculation of the credit. If the carrier discovers an error in the original request for policy credit, the revised information must be submitted to the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau for recalculation. If the insured does not furnish records to verify the payrolls and hours worked originally submitted and used in the calculation of the credit, there shall be no credit applied to the policy.

The credit authorized by the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau shall appear on Item 4 of the policy. If the credit applicable to the policy is not available at the time of policy issuance, the carrier shall endorse the policy to provide the appropriate credit information once a qualifying application has been processed and the PCRB has notified the carrier of the credit determined on the basis of such application.

Report Pennsylvania Construction Class Premium Credit on the information page and unit statistical report under Code 9046.

Carriers are required to use the approved form to notify all their insureds, who have one or more construction classifications on their policy, that they may be eligible for a premium adjustment credit.

"Construction classifications" are those class codes that are 6xx or 26xx codes, which are direct employment and temporary staffing construction classifications, respectively. For example, direct employment classification code 615 and associated temporary staffing classification code 2615 are both PPCPAP-eligible class codes.

## 2. Appeals

The PCRB's determination of an individual risk's eligibility for or the percentage of credit under the Pennsylvania Construction Classification Premium Adjustment Program may be appealed pursuant to RULE XVI, APPEALS FROM APPLICATION OF THE RATING SYSTEM PROCEDURE, Section 1 of this Manual.

# RULE X - CANCELLATION

## A. WHO MAY CANCEL

1. The Cancellation Condition of the Standard Policy permits cancellation by the insured or by the
   insurance carrier.

2. Pennsylvania enacted legislation that prohibits an insurance carrier from cancelling workers'
   compensation policies during their term, except for nonpayment of premium and/or failure to reimburse
   the deductible amount.

### Reinstatement

When a notice of cancellation for non-payment has been issued, if the insurer thereafter receives payment
and voluntarily determines to reinstate the policy, such reinstatement of coverage must be retroactive to the
cancellation date.

Alternatively, if the insurer does not want to reinstate the policy as of the cancellation date but voluntarily
determines to resume coverage after a lapse in coverage, the insurer must issue a new policy. Such new
policy must carry the carrier rating values effective on the policy effective date of the new policy.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: CANCELLATION NOTICES MUST BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO THE
PCRB WITHIN 10 DAYS OF ISSUANCE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT FAILURE TO SUBMIT SUCH
NOTICE WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIME SHALL NOT INVALIDATE ANY CANCELLATION WHICH HAS
BEEN MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE POLICY.**

## B. PREMIUM DETERMINATION – CANCELLATION BY THE INSURANCE CARRIER

Premium for the canceled policy shall be computed as follows:

1. Carrier Rating Values and Payroll

   Apply carrier rating values to the payroll developed during the period the policy was in effect.

2. Experience Rating

   Apply any experience rating modification in accordance with the rules of the Experience Rating Plan
   Section. Refer to Rule VI-E

## C. PREMIUM DETERMINATION—CANCELLATION BY THE INSURED, WHEN RETIRING FROM BUSINESS

Compute the premium as provided in B above if a policy is cancelled by the insured when:

1. All the work covered by the policy has been completed, or

2. All interest in any business covered by the policy has been sold, or

3. The insured has retired from all business covered by the policy.

## D. PREMIUM DETERMINATION—CANCELLATION BY THE INSURED, EXCEPT WHEN RETIRING FROM BUSINESS

The premium for the canceled policy shall be based on the Short Rate Cancellation Table in this rule and computed
as follows:

Page 69                                                                                                  UNDERWRITING RULES

1. Actual Payroll

   Determine the payroll developed during the period the policy was in effect.

2. Extended Payroll and Number of Days

   a. Extended Payroll

      Extend such payroll pro-rata based on the number of days for which the policy was written divided
      by the number of days the policy remained in force to produce the full policy payroll.

      Example
      A policy written for 250 days that remained in effect for 185 days produced a payroll of $55,500.
      Payroll extended for the original policy term — $55,500 x 250/185 = $75,000.

   b. Extended Number of Days

      The extended number of days shall be determined by dividing the number of days the policy was in
      force by the number of days for which the policy was written and multiplying the quotient by 365
      days. When the policy was written for a one year period, the extended number of days will equal the
      number of days the policy remained in force

3. Carrier Rate

   Apply carrier rate to the payroll in 2a. above.

4. Experience Rating

   Apply any experience rating modification in accordance with the rules of the Experience Rating Plan
   Section. Refer to Rule VI-H.

5. Short Rate Percentage

   Based on the extended number of days calculated in 2.b., apply the short rate percentage shown in the
   Short Rate Cancellation Table in this rule to the premium computed on the basis of the extended
   payroll in order to determine the short rate portion of the premium.

6. Example of a Short Rate Cancellation

   A policy originally written for 250 days in effect for 185 days develops actual payroll of $55,500, carrier
   rate of $.50.

   a. Payroll extended to full policy term = $55,500 x 250 = $75,000
                                                             185

   b. Full policy term premium = $75,000 x $.50 = $375

   c. Extended number of days = 185 x 365 = 270
                                 250

   d. Short rate percentage for 270 days = 80%

   e. Short rate premium = $375 x .80 = $300

   f. Total premium for canceled policy = $300

It applies to such employees while working on navigable waters of the United States and also while working on any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway, or other area adjoining such navigable waters customarily used for loading, unloading, repairing or building a vessel. It does not cover masters or members of the crew of a vessel. For complete details see U.S. Code (1946), Title 33, Section 901-49, amended by Public Law 92-576.

# RULE XIII – THE ADMIRALITY LAW AND THE FEDERAL EMPLOYERS LIABILITY ACT

> NOTE: The Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau has no jurisdiction over the PCRB rating values or classification for Admiralty or Federal Employers Liability exposure. The following rule was published by the National Council on Compensation Insurance and is shown here for information purposes only.

## A. General Explanation

### 1. Admiralty Law

Masters and members of the crews of vessels are not covered under state workers compensation laws nor under the U.S.L. & H.W. Act. They are subject to admiralty law and, if injured, have the right to sue their employers for damages in the Admiralty Courts where the proceeding is in the nature of an employers' liability suit. They also have the right to transportation, wages, maintenance and cure. Such seamen are subject to a Federal law, the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, known as the Jones Act (46 U.S. Code, Section 688, 1970) which applies the provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act to seamen. Every person employed on board a vessel is deemed to be a seaman if connected with the operation or welfare of the vessel while in navigable waters. Usually, navigable waters are defined as those which form a continuous highway for interstate or international commerce.

### 2. Federal Employers Liability Act (F.E.L.A.)

The Federal Employers Liability Act applies to employees of interstate railroads. Such employees are not subject to state workers compensation laws. This federal law imposes liability for damages on the railroad if the injured railroad employee can show any negligence on the part of the railroad. For complete details, see 45 U.S. Code, Sections 51-60, 1970.

## B. Description of Coverage Programs

The Standard Policy may be used to provide insurance for liability under one or more state workers compensation laws and also for liability under admiralty law or F.E.L.A. There are two programs to furnish such insurance:

### 1. Program I

Provides under Part One - Workers Compensation Insurance statutory liability - under the workers compensation law of any state designated in the Information Page and under Part Two - Employers Liability Insurance, Employers liability - for damages under admiralty law or F.E.L.A., subject to a standard limit of liability of $25,000.

### 2. Program II

Provides the same coverage as Program I, but with the addition of Voluntary Compensation. Under Program II, the insurance carrier will offer a settlement of a claim strictly in accord with the statutory benefits provided in the workers' compensation law designated in the Voluntary Compensation Endorsement attached to the policy as if the claim were subject to such law, instead of subject to the laws of negligence. If the offer of settlement is rejected, Employers liability then applies to such claim or suit, with the same standard limit as for Program I.

## C. Coverage

### 1. Admiralty Law Endorsements

To provide Program I for admiralty law, attach the Standard Maritime Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 02 01A). To provide Program II for admiralty law, also attach the Standard Voluntary, Maritime Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 02 03).

2. Admiralty Law Coverage Options

   a. The Maritime Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 02 01A) excludes liability to provide transportation,
      wages, maintenance and cure. This endorsement may optionally include a provision to insure such
      liability for an additional premium based on an (a) rate.

3. F.E.L.A. Endorsements

   To provide Program I for employments subject to F.E.L.A., attach the Standard Federal Employers
   Liability Act Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 01 04). To provide Program II, also attach the Standard
   Voluntary Compensation and Employers Liability Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 03 11A).

4. U.S.L. & H.W. Act

   When insurance is provided for liability under admiralty law or F.E.L.A., insurance for liability under the
   U.S.L. & H.W. Act also may be necessary. To provide such insurance, attach the Standard Longshore
   and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 01 06A).

D. Limits of Liability

   1. Standard Limits

      The standard limit of liability under Part Two - Employers Liability Insurance for admiralty or F.E.L.A.
      insurance under Program I or II is $25,000.

      a. Accident Limit
         The limit of liability applies to all bodily injury arising out of any one accident.

      b. Disease Limit
         The limit of liability also applies as a separate aggregate limit for all bodily injury by disease. The
         aggregate limit applies separately to bodily injury by disease arising out of work in each state shown
         in Item 3-A of the Information Page.

      c. Show Limits on Endorsement
         These limits of liability must be stated in the Maritime Coverage Endorsement and/or the
         Federal Employers Liability Act Coverage Endorsement (WC 00 01 04).

   2. Increased Limits

      Increased limits for liability under Part Two - Employers Liability Insurance are available. The additional
      premium for increased limits shall be determined by applying the factor in the following Table for
      Increased Limits to the total premium for admiralty or F.E.L.A. classifications before application of:

      a. Expense Constant

      b. Experience rating modification

      c. Premium discount or retrospective rating adjustment

## RULE XV – FINAL EARNED PREMIUM DETERMINATION

### A. ACTUAL PAYROLL

Final earned premium for the policy shall be determined on actual, instead of estimated, payroll or other
premium basis.

### B. PREMIUM DETERMINATION

The determination of final earned premium is governed by the rules, classifications and PCRB rating values
and carrier rating values, subject to modification by applicable rating plans.

### C. AUDIT RIGHTS OF CARRIER

The insurance carrier has the right to compute earned premium based on an examination of original payroll
records and books of account of the insured, in accordance with Part Five - Premium, Section G (Audit) of the
Standard Policy.

### D. AUTHORIZED CLASSIFICATIONS

Only the classifications shown on a Data Card issued by the PCRB shall be used in auditing the payroll of
that employer. The insuring carrier shall contact the PCRB in writing in any instance where the authorized
classifications do not describe the employer's operations as delineated in Rule IV, C. 2. c., Section 1 of this
Manual.

### E. AUDIT NONCOMPLIANCE CHARGE

1. If the employer does not comply with Part Five—Premium, Section G. (Audit) of the policy, the employer
will be considered noncompliant with the policy terms and conditions. When this occurs, the carrier may
apply an Audit Noncompliance Charge (ANC) subject to the conditions in this rule. The charge is
determined by applying the ANC multiplier to the ANC Basis shown in the table below:

| ANC Basis | ANC Multiplier |
|-----------|----------------|
| Estimated Annual Premium | Two times |

2. On a multistate policy, the ANC applies only to the exposure in the states where an employer is
noncompliant with an audit and where this ANC rule is approved for use

3. The ANC is a premium charge and is applied in accordance with the applicable state premium
algorithm. The ANC is not part of standard premium.

4. The application of the ANC is subject to the following conditions:

   a. Carriers must comply with all applicable state laws and/or regulations related to audits of workers
   compensation insurance policies.

   b. The Audit Noncompliance Charge Endorsement is optional. When used, the Audit Noncompliance
   Charge Endorsement and/or applicable state-specific endorsement must be attached to the policy
   at inception of the policy term being audited.

   c. The carrier must make two attempts to obtain the audit information and/or complete the audit. At
   each attempt, the carrier must notify the employer regarding the specific required records and the
   amount of the ANC to be applied if the employer continues to refuse to comply with the audit.

## RULE XVIII – PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS, PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYER AGREEMENTS AND PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYER SERVICES

### A. DEFINITIONS

The following words and phrases when used in this rule shall have the meanings given to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. (These definitions are intended to be consistent with the definitions used in Act 102 of 2012.):

- Client – Any person who enters into a Professional Employer Agreement with a Professional Employer Organization.

- Co-employer – A Professional Employer Organization or Client.

- Co-employment Relationship A relationship which is intended to be an ongoing relationship rather than temporary or project specific one, wherein the rights, duties and obligations of an employer which arise out of an employment relationship have been allocated between Co-employers pursuant to a Professional Employer Agreement and Act 102 of 2012.

- Covered Employee – An individual co-employed by a Professional Employer Organization and a client who meets the following criteria:

  o The individual has received written notice of co-employment with the Professional Employer

  o Organization.

  o The individual's Co-employment Relationship is pursuant to a Professional Employer Agreement subject to Act 102 of 2012.

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

- Professional Employer Agreement – A contract by and between a Client and a Professional
Employer Organization that provides:

  o for the co-employment of Covered Employees;

  o for the allocation of employer rights and obligations between the Client and the Professional
    Employer Organization with respect to the Covered Employees; and

  o that the Professional Employer Organization and the Client assume the responsibilities required
    under Act 102 of 2012.

- Professional Employer Organization or PEO – Any person engaged in the business of providing
Professional Employer Services.

- Professional Employer Services – The business of entering into Co-employment Relationships under
Act 102 of 2012.

Under Professional Employer Agreements one business provides workers to another business entity under
an agreement wherein all or substantially all of the employees of the Client are thereafter employed by the
PEO and leased back to the original employer through a Professional Employer Agreement. The Professional
Employer Agreement is long term in nature and is specifically not an arrangement to provide temporary help
services to fill seasonal or temporary staffing shortages.

Act 102 of 2012 provides that both the PEO and the Client shall be an employer for Covered Employees
assigned to the Client for purposes of Act 102 of 2012 and the Act of June 2, 1915 (P.L. 736, No. 338),
known as the Workers' Compensation Act.

## B. POLICY ISSUANCE

The responsibility to provide workers' compensation coverage for Covered Employees shall be specifically
allocated in the Professional Employer Agreement to either the Client or the Professional Employer
Organization.

1. When the responsibility to provide workers compensation coverage is allocated to the PEO, the PEO
   must provide coverage for all Covered Employees assigned to the Client.

2. When the responsibility to provide workers compensation coverage is allocated to the Client, the Client
   must provide coverage for all of its Covered Employees and Direct Hire Employees.

## C. METHODS OF COVERAGE

PEOs and Clients may qualify to self-insure their respective obligations under the Workers' Compensation
Act. In addition, there are three available options for Clients and PEOs that have entered into Professional
Employer Agreements to insure their statutory obligations under the Workers' Compensation Act as Co-
employers for their Covered Employees. These options are as described following:

1. Option One – The PEO provides workers' compensation insurance for Covered Employees of the Client
   by purchasing a Multiple Coordinated Policy (MCP) to insure such Covered Employees.

---
PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS COMPENSATION MANUAL
Effective: July 1, 2023
Page 91

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

Under this option, a separate workers' compensation insurance policy is issued to the PEO on behalf of the Client. These policies insure the Client's Covered Employees without leaving uninsured gaps or creating overlaps in coverage with other insurance policies. Each policy written on a Multiple Coordinated Policy basis shall be issued to the PEO as the primary named insured and must identify both the PEO and the Client as insureds. The named insured must be of the form "PEO Name L/C/F Client Name." The Pennsylvania Multiple Coordinated Policy Endorsement (W C 37 03 11) must be added to each such policy, specifying which Covered Employees are insured by that policy.

- The insurer must assign risk classifications to each Client based on the totality of the Client's Pennsylvania operations regardless of whether workers engaged therein are provided under one or more Professional Employer Agreements or are Direct Hire Employees of that Client.
- Policies written on an MCP Basis by the same insurer for a PEO as named insured may be combinable by agreement between the PEO and the insurer for purposes of premium discount, retrospective rating, schedule rating and other approved pricing programs. Such approved pricing programs may be based on the combined total standard premium and losses of all Multiple Coordinated Policies issued to the PEO as the primary named insured.
- If the Client has any employees that are not Covered Employees of the PEO (whether Direct Hire Employees or Covered Employees obtained from another PEO), workers' compensation coverage for these other employees must be provided under a separate policy or policies. Attach the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Client Exclusion Endorsement (W C 00 03 22 A) to exclude coverage for liability to employees leased from the PEO named in the endorsement.

2. Option Two – The Client provides workers' compensation insurance for its Covered Employees.

If the Client is responsible for providing workers' compensation insurance coverage for it Covered Employees, it may purchase a standard workers' compensation policy insuring its Covered Employees and its Direct Hire Employees, if any.

- When the Client secures coverage for its leased workers through a policy in its name, include the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Extension Endorsement (WC 00 03 20 B), which specifies that the Client's policy will apply to injuries to Covered Employees obtained from the PEO named in the endorsement as though the PEO were an insured under the policy and that the insurer will not ask the PEO's insurer to share in a loss(es) covered by the endorsement.
- The insurer must assign risk classifications to each Client based on the totality of the Client's Pennsylvania operations regardless of whether workers engaged therein are provided under one or more Professional Employer Agreements or are Direct Hire Employees of the Client.

3. Option Three – The PEO provided workers' compensation insurance coverage for its Clients' Covered Employees by purchasing a Master Policy to insure such Covered Employees.

Act 102 of 2012 requires the following conditions to be met in order for a PEO to insure Covered Employees of its Clients on a Master Policy Basis:

a. The insurer underwriting the Master Policy must report separate experience data to the PCRB for each Client insured by the Master Policy in a format complying with all requirements of the approved Pennsylvania Statistical Plan.

b. The insurer must assign risk classifications to each Client based on the totality of the Client's Pennsylvania operations regardless of whether workers engaged therein are provided under one or more Professional Employer Agreements or are Direct Hire Employees of the Client.

Section I
UNDERWRITING RULES

c. If and when applicable, the insurer must assign separate experience modifications, Merit
Rating adjustments, construction classification premium adjustments and/or Certified Safety
Committee Program credits to the exposures of each Client covered by a Master Policy based
on the Client's entire Pennsylvania operations.

(1) If the Client has any employees that are not Covered Employees of the PEO (whether
Direct Hire Employees or Covered Employees obtained from another PEO), workers'
compensation coverage for these other employees must be provided under a separate
policy or policies. Attach the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Client Exclusion
Endorsement (WC 00
03 22 A) to exclude coverage for liability to employees leased from the PEO named in
the endorsement.

Use of Master Policies is subject to prior approval by the PCRB of the issuing carrier's policy
issuance and data reporting procedures as satisfactorily complying with the requirements of Act
102 of 2012.

D. CLIENT POLICY OBLIGATIONS

A client retains the statutory obligation to provide workers' compensation coverage for employees that
are not
Covered Employees pursuant to a Professional Employer Agreement.

In providing such coverage, the Client may either self-insure those exposures or the Client may
purchase a standard workers' compensation policy through a licensed insurance company.

E. PEO POLICY OBLIGATIONS

A PEO retains the statutory obligation to provide workers' compensation coverage for its own Direct
Hire
Employees that are not Covered Employees pursuant to a Professional Employer Agreement.

In providing such coverage, the PEO may either self-insure those exposures or the PEO may purchase
a standard workers' compensation policy through a licensed insurance company.

The Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Exclusion Endorsement (WC 00 03 21 A), which
deletes coverage for workers leased to Clients named in the endorsement, must be attached to the
PEO's own policy so that it insures only the PEO's Direct Hire Employees.

F. CANCELLATION PROVISIONS

1. Cancellation by the Professional Employer Organization (PEO)

a. If the PEO terminates the Professional Employer Agreement with the Client, termination of
workers'
compensation coverage for Covered Employees by the insurer shall be effective the sooner of:

• Sixty (60) days after written notice of the intent to terminate workers' compensation
coverage has been given by the PEO to the Client.
• Fifteen (15) days after written notice of intent to terminate workers' compensation
coverage by the insurer for non-payment of premium has been given by the PEO to the
Client.
• The date upon which workers' compensation coverage for covered employees is
transferred to the Client's own workers' compensation policy or is otherwise replaced.

b. All requirements of the PEO in regard to the notification of Clients concerning workers'

compensation coverage provided under a policy issued to the PEO for Covered Employees of
the PEO continue to apply after written notice is given pursuant to the above.

c. The Client shall pay for all workers' compensation coverage provided by the insurer, including
reasonable administrative expenses, subsequent to the termination of the Professional
Employer Agreement by the PEO.

d. If workers' compensation coverage is provided through a workers' compensation policy issues
to the PEO on behalf of the Client who has been given notice of termination pursuant to the
above, the PEO is required to notify the affected insurer of the notification.

## 2. Cancellation by the Client

If the Professional Employer Agreement is terminated by the Client, the Client assumes the
statutory obligation to provide workers' compensation for its employees as of the date termination
is requested. The Client may secure coverage for its Covered Employees through another
Professional Employer Agreement with a different PEO, through an approved self-insurance
program or with a single policy covering all of the Covered Employees of the Client and the Client's
Direct Hire Employees.

## 3. Notification Requirements

If the Professional Employer Agreement provides for the PEO to provide workers' compensation
insurance for Covered Employees, the PEO shall notify the insurance carrier of record of any
cancellation, non-renewal or termination of a Professional Employer Agreement under which the
PEO assumed the obligation to provide workers' compensation insurance for Covered Employees
within ten (10) days following the date the notification of cancellation or termination is provided to
the Client. The insurance carrier of record shall notify the licensed rating organization of any
cancellation, non-renewal or termination of workers' compensation coverage for Covered
Employees by the PEO's insurer or any change in insurers for the Covered Employees within ten
(10) days of the effective date of cancellation, termination or change of insurers.

A. DEFINITIONS

HOME AREA

The city, township or borough in which a volunteer fire company is located.

OUTSIDE AREA

A city, township or borough (or portion thereof) different from the home area and protected pursuant to a fire protection contract provided by a volunteer fire company located in the home area.

VOLUNTEER AND PAID STAFF

In jurisdictions where a combination of volunteer and paid firemen are employed, the following procedure shall be followed to arrive at the proper population to be used for volunteer firemen premium calculation:

The number of salaried firemen and active volunteers shall be determined at the inception of the policy and shall not be subject to revision until renewal. 'Active volunteers' refers to members of the company who are on the roster as available to respond to a fire alarm.

Determine the number of salaried firemen and active volunteers, e.g. 14 paid and 35 volunteers, total staff 49. Take 35/49 or 71% of the service, as being provided by volunteers. Apply 71% to the population, e.g. population 37,769 x 71% = 26,816 as a revised population base.

B. The annual loss cost charge shall be determined on the basis of the sum of the populations from:

(1) The Volunteer Fire Company or Companies' "Home Area," (or portion thereof).

(2) Any "Outside Area" served by the "Home Area" company or companies. When an "Outside Area" is served by fire companies from two or more different "Home Areas," the separate populations served by each company shall be determined.

C. Population

Municipal populations are determined on the basis of the figures provided by the U. S. Bureau of the Census as published in actual population counts (Decennial Census Population). No other population reference source will be used.

A carrier or volunteer fire company may submit a Volunteer Firemen Exposure Form (VFEF) to the PCRB via the PCRB website to change or confirm areas served by a volunteer fire company.

PENNSYLVANIA RETROSPECTIVE DEVELOPMENT FACTORS*

Retrospective development factors for first, second and third adjustments are calculated below. They are intended
for application to retrospective plans with no loss limitation.

| Adjustment | RDF |
|------------|-----|
| First Adjustment | 0.2242 |
| Second Adjustment | 0.1113 |
| Third Adjustment | 0.0696 |

For those companies using retrospective development factors with loss limitations,

RDF(LIM) = (1.0 - ELF) x RDF

RDF(LIM) = Retrospective Development Factors at limited basis
ELF = Excess Loss Factors for given Hazard Group and Loss
Limitation
RDF = Retrospective Development Factors without Loss Limitation

For
Example:

The $25,000 limit Hazard Group C ELF = 0.663

Then First Adjustment RDF = (1 - 0.663) * 0.2242
                          = 0.0756

* The use of retrospective development factors is optional.

## DEFINITIONS

### ALL EMPLOYEES EXCEPT OFFICE:
There is no payroll division between a business classification designated "all employees except office" and Code 951. Such business classification contemplates all salespersons, including but not necessarily limited to over-the-road salespersons, floor salespersons, inspectors, interior designers or decorators employed by any business assignable to that classification.

### ALL EMPLOYEES INCLUDING OFFICE:
There is no payroll division between a business classification designated "all employees including office" and Code 951, Code 953, and Code 822. Such business classification contemplates all salespersons employed by any business assignable to that classification. Such classification also contemplates clerical office personnel engaged in the administration of the business, regardless of whether the office personnel are located at or contiguous to the business' location or a location separate from the business' location.

### ALL EMPLOYEES INCLUDING OFFICE EXCEPT WORKFARE OR HOME HEALTH CARE AND/OR HOME CARE SERVICES:
This definition is the same as the "all employees including office" definition above except for the designated separate personnel (e.g., workfare, home health care and home services), which shall be subject to separate classification as provided for in this Manual.

### N.O.C.:
Not Otherwise Classified. A classification so designated is to be assigned when there are two or more potential classification assignments, and there is no specific Underwriting Guide entry for a business' principal product or line of merchandise. For example, in the event there is no Underwriting Guide entry for a principal line of merchandise being sold wholesale, the assignment is Code 924.

### PRINCIPAL:
When a store sells several types of merchandise, each of which may be subject to a different classification, such store shall be classified based on the principal category of merchandise sold. The term "principal" means more than 50 percent of the business' overall revenue.

### PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED:
The business activity that generates more than 50 percent of a business' overall revenue.

### RATING SYSTEM:
Includes all workers' compensation pricing programs filed by PCRB with and approved by the Insurance Commissioner. Such include but are not limited to: the assignment by PCRB of an individual business to a particular classification, the continuation or discontinuation of an entity's(ies') previous experience to the experience rating of new ownership, revision of losses used in a business' experience modification or merit rating, an individual business' eligibility for and/or the percentage of credit under the Pennsylvania Construction Classification Premium Adjustment Program, or the discount or surcharge applied to a business eligible for the Merit Rating Plan.

### TO BE SEPARATELY CLASSIFIED OR SEPARATELY CLASSIFY:
When either of these terms is found in a classification's definition, the specified task designated "to be separately classified" or "separately classified" must be separately staffed by non-interchanging personnel.

### TO BE SEPARATELY RATED OR SEPARATELY RATE:
When either of these terms is found in a classification's definition, the payroll of personnel interchanging between that classification's tasks (e.g., shop) and also performing the specified function that is designated "to be separately rated" or "separately rate" (e.g., erection, installation) may be divided between that class and class(es) designated for the specified function, provided the employer's original payroll records show an allocation of payroll to both classifications for each interchanging employee. Estimated or percentage allocation of payroll is not permitted. When separate payroll records are not maintained, the entire payroll of the interchanging employees shall be assigned to the insuring carrier's highest valued classification representing any part of their work.

## SUBCLASSIFICATION– CARRIER OPTION

The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, permits an insurer to develop sub classifications to the PCRB's classification system as approved by the Insurance Commissioner. Any such sub classification shall be filed by the developing insurer with the PCRB and the Insurance Commissioner thirty (30) days prior to its use. The insurer's filing shall demonstrate that payroll and loss data produced under such sub classification can be reported to the PCRB consistent with the PCRB's classification system and statistical plan. Otherwise, the Insurance Commissioner shall disapprove the subclassification filing.

## TEMPORARY STAFFING CLASSIFICATION

A temporary staffing contractor hires employees and assigns those employees to an unrelated business for temporary work assignments varying in duration from one day to any period less than one year. Temporary staffing classifications are identified by a four-digit number that is 2,000 greater than the corresponding direct employment classification. For example, for direct employment classification 323, the corresponding temporary staffing classification is 2323.The corresponding temporary staffing classification for each direct employment classification, where applicable, is identified in the direct employment classification's entry in the Section 2 – Alphabetic Classification Underwriting Guide. Refer to the Temporary Staffing Contractors entry in the General Auditing & Classification Information section of this Manual for additional detail regarding the classification procedure for temporary staffing contractors.

## 263       PAPER COATING/FINISHING – BY CONTRACTOR

Applicable to a business principally engaged in operations involving various types of coatings which are mixed in mixers or agitators and run into troughs of coating machines.

## 898      CATERER – ALL EMPLOYEES EXCEPT OFFICE

There are four types of catering businesses that provide food service: social, industrial or institutional,
concession or mobile.

Social caterers are hired for a single event such as a wedding, party or business affair. The social caterer
provides the client with a menu of food items, types of beverages, colors of linens, other available
amenities and, if applicable, a listing of the types of entertainment. The client is then responsible for
choosing food, beverages, color schemes and/or entertainment. Once all of the services to be provided
have been determined, the social caterer may produce a contract based on the predetermined services.
Alcoholic beverages may be provided at the event, but the sale of alcoholic beverages is not the principal
source of revenue. This type of catering may be performed either on the caterer's premises or at the
customer's premises.

Institutional or industrial caterers operate under contract to provide in-house food service for businesses,
hospitals, nursing homes, schools or similar customers. These catering operations generally plan menus
and perform the preparation and sale of food in a cafeteria-style environment.

Concession caterers are usually located at but are not limited to airports, sports stadiums, amusement
parks, theaters or museums. The concession caterer operates under contract with the client facility to
provide prepared food and beverages to the client's patrons. The concession caterer may also use "walking
vendors" throughout the venue.

Mobile caterers provide food and beverages from a truck with cooking equipment, parked on the sidewalk
at locations such as a construction site, factory or university with large commuting student body or travel a
predetermined daily route.

OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDED:

customers for immediate consumption. Where food is not prepared, the establishment may sell packaged
snacks. In either scenario, food preparation and service is not a majority of the employer's operations.

940      RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES – ALL
EMPLOYEES EXCEPT OFFICE AND THE SEPARATE STAFF OF A CERTIFIED SHELTERED
WORKSHOP

Includes operations licensed as Intermediate Care Facilities for the Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities
(ICF/IID) regardless of client count or location. Also included are schools and daycare activities operated by
the facility.

ICF/IIDs are licensed by the state to provide on a regular basis, health related care and services to the
intellectually disabled, who do not require the degree of care or treatment which a hospital or skilled
nursing facility is designed to provide. These facilities regardless of client number provide unique and
specialized residential, medical and habilitation services to its clients. Community Residential Facilities
(CRF) and ICF/IID - 9 or more residents have similar regulations, goals and staffing patterns. The large
ICF/IID receives federal funds under Medicaid, while the CRF receives state funds.

The larger ICF/IIDs (9 or more clients) usually provide educational, workshop/vocational and physical
therapy programs at one campus with many residents living in cottages having no more than 8 residents
each. Supervision may be provided by staff in three 8-hour shifts. Smaller ICF/IIDs (8 or fewer clients)
also assigned to this classification provide community-based programs which are designed to facilitate the
client's movement to a less restrictive environment than the larger facilities. These community-based
ICF/IIDs employ a relatively high staff to client ratio and 24-hour supervision with at least one staff member
monitoring overnight activity. Smaller ICF/IIDs may serve clients from higher functioning to profoundly
intellectually disabled.

OPERATIONS NOT INCLUDED:

1.      Assign Code 964 to separately-staffed certified work centers.
2.      Assign Code 941 to separately-staffed group homes for eight or fewer residents operated by
        Community Residential Facilities located off campus.
3.      Assign Code 979 to separately-staffed personal care homes located off campus.

        HEART & LUNG ACT (Act 193, P.L. 477. Approved June 28, 1935, As Amended)

This Act provides a special form of workers' compensation benefit to professional police officers and
firefighters injured on the job. The compensation under the Act is provided only to the aforementioned
employees when the work related injury is temporary but totally disabling. Typical injuries covered by the
Act are sprains and strains, back and knee injuries and broken bones. Police officers and firefighters
typically recover from these kinds of injuries, so they are temporary. However, during the recovery process,
the employees tend to be unable to perform their jobs.

Heart & Lung Act compensation provides the employee 100 percent of his/her straight-time pay, while
maintaining all benefits. The injured employee is also entitled to the benefit of any pay raises that occur
during the period of his/her disability. The Pennsylvania Workers' Act provides for payment of two-thirds of
the employee's salary at the time of injury.

Exclude from the payroll audit remuneration paid under the Heart & Lung Act subject to verification of
appropriate supporting documentation by the auditor.

Reasons for excluding such remuneration:
• Such compensation is considered workers' compensation payment, which is not construed to be
  remuneration.
• Remuneration paid under the Heart & Lung Act is a benefit prescribed by law, i.e., municipal
  employers had no choice but to grant this remuneration. As such, these payments should be
  treated as a benefit provided by the employer and not treated as remuneration. In contrast, regular
  sick pay is voluntarily provided to employees as wages earned for services rendered and is,
  therefore, included as remuneration.
• While sick pay is included as salary for income taxation, payments under the Heart & Lung Act are
  excluded for income tax purposes.

If coverage is desired under the U.S.L. Act, the Federal increase factor shown in Section 2 shall be applied. A single policy may be issued including Pennsylvania Act coverage, U.S.L. coverage and Admiralty coverage providing the classification of operations in the policy declarations is subdivided to clearly indicate the classes and rating values for Dredging operations subject to:

(a)     The Pennsylvania Act alone or including U.S.L. Act coverage and
(b)     Admiralty jurisdiction.

In lieu of a single policy, two separate policies may be issued as follows:

(a)     A standard Pennsylvania policy using rates approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, applicable to Pennsylvania coverage only, or to Pennsylvania and U.S.L. coverage. Such policy shall be endorsed to exclude Admiralty coverage.
(b)     An Admiralty policy.

AIRCRAFT OPERATION

Applicable to the payroll of the pilot and all members of the flying crew. In the case of aircraft owned or
operated by an employer in the conduct of his business, this classification shall apply to the payroll of
executive officers or other employees acting as pilots or members of the flying crew. If the records of
the employer clearly indicate the weeks in which flying is performed by such employees, (1) only the
payroll for each week during any part of which the employee has engaged in flight duties shall be
assigned to Code 7421 unless the classification applicable to the employee's non-flying operations
carries a higher insuring carrier rating value in which event such classification shall apply and (2) the
payroll for each week in which no flying has been done shall be assigned to those classifications which
would otherwise apply. If the employer's records do not clearly indicate the weeks in which flying is
performed by such employees, the entire payroll for such employees shall be assigned to Code 7421
unless the classification applicable to the employee's non-flying operations has a higher insuring carrier
rating value in which event such classification shall apply.

Assign the payroll and losses of employees who are transported as passengers (and who are not
members of the flying crew) to their normal applicable classification.

AUTOMOBILE DISMANTLERS

A business whose operations include the dismantling of automobiles or other types of vehicles to recover
usable/salable used parts shall be classified pursuant to the manner in which the employer is principally
engaged. Please see the "Definitions" Ruling and Interpretation for additional information on principally engaged.
Below find examples of reasonably common classification assignments for such businesses:

1. Assign Code 815 to businesses principally engaged in dismantling automobiles or other vehicles to
   recover usable/salable used parts and the sale of such and new parts.
2. Assign Code 815 to businesses principally engaged in performing automobile repairs (e.g., mechanical
   or body).
3. Assign Code 818 to businesses principally engaged in the sale of new and/or used automobiles or other
   vehicles (e.g., trucks, motorcycles).

4. Assign Code 858 to businesses principally engaged in the collection, handling and sale of ferrous scrap metal.

5. Assign Code 859 to businesses principally engaged in the collection, handling and sale of nonferrous scrap metal.

6. Assign Code 860 to businesses dismantling automobiles or other vehicles and collecting and handling a combination of ferrous and/or nonferrous scrap metal and/or other secondhand commodities (e.g., paper, glass) with no principal line of merchandise.

7. Assign Code 934 to businesses principally engaged in the sale of new automobile parts. There may be payroll division with Code 815 when such businesses also dismantle automobiles when the following conditions are fulfilled: the automobile dismantling is conducted in a physically separate work area by separate employee crews and the majority of the automobile parts are sold to unrelated customers and are neither installed or used by the business for repair services.

8. Assign Code 825 to businesses principally engaged in the storage of automobiles (e.g., an impound lot) or in the parking of customers' automobiles.

## AUTOMOBILE SERVICE/GASOLINE STATION

It is common for automobile service stations or gasoline stations to be engaged in both the sale of gasoline and the performance of automobile service or repair. When both operations are conducted at the same or contiguous location, such establishment shall be classified on the basis of the principal operation:

When more than 50 percent of the gross receipts result from automobile service or repair, assign Code 815, Automobile Service Center.

When more than 50 percent of the gross receipts are from gasoline sales, assign Code 816, Automobile Filling Station.

An assignment of Code 815 or Code 816 is mutually exclusive for operations conducted at the same or contiguous location.

Please refer to the separate entries in the General Auditing & Classification Information section "Self-Service Gasoline Stations and Convenience Grocers" and "Truck Stops" for information on classifying such enterprises.

## BAKERY PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTION

Payroll developed in the wholesale distribution of bakery products, including but not necessarily limited to bread, cakes, pies, cookies or crackers by a baker whose production facilities are located in another state or by an independent business (not related to a bakery) must be assigned to Code 924.

## CERAMIC SHOPS

The operations contemplated by the term "ceramic shops" are manual with little or no mechanization. The major material is liquid clay known as slip. After mixing, the clay is poured or pumped into plaster of paris or rubber molds. When dry, the clay is now called green ware (an unfired shape or figurine) which is manually trimmed, inventoried or shelved for further hardening and curing, then sold to customers. Retail customers often paint or finish the green ware and return it to the shop for firing. A ceramic shop will often hold classes for students who will perform all of the above functions except for the firing. The ceramic shop may also sell paints, artist-type brushes, decals and ceramic hand tools.

Payroll developed in operations as discussed above shall be assigned to Code 928.

## CLASSIFICATION AND AUDIT INQUIRIES

Written classification and audit inquiries may be submitted to the Classification & Field Operations Department of the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau (PCRB) in one of the following methods. PCRB's preferred method is by means of PCRB's website (www.pcrb.com) by clicking on "Classification" on the website's main menu and then clicking on "Classification Inquiries." PCRB will also accept written inquiries by means of facsimile or the USPS.

For the Classification & Field Operations Department of the PCRB to operate effectively, it is important that the PCRB have the full cooperation of every carrier, agent and employer in providing the essential information that the PCRB needs to make classification rulings and to otherwise be of service to you.

The information that the Classification & Field Operations Department needs to properly respond to inquiries from carriers, agents or employers on classification questions is:

- A complete listing of all Pennsylvania operating locations
- The exact name (as shown in Item 1 of the policy) and address of the business in question
- The PCRB file number (if available) of the business in question (see Rating and Underwriting Reference via the Application Login or "Classification inquiries")
- A full and accurate written description of the business in question, including any available audits, loss control reports and/or insurance application information
- Reason why a change in classification is being requested, i.e., has a substantial change in the employer's operations recently occurred.
- The name, title and telephone number of a management representative whom a PCRB field representative can contact to schedule an appointment with the employer (in the event that a field survey is necessary)
- Employer's website address

The information that the Field Operations Department needs to properly respond to disputes concerning payroll allocation on a final audit is:

- A request in writing from the insured or the insured's agent of record outlining the nature of the dispute.
- A complete and accurate description of the business operations during the policy term in dispute and if available a copy of the final audit as issued by the carrier.
- A complete listing of all employees being disputed including the names of each employee, a description of the duties of the employees during the policy term of the audit dispute and an explanation why the duties of the employees do not support the carrier's assignment.

If should be noted that it is not the PCRB's role to become involved in every dispute involving the allocation of a particular employee's payroll to a given classification. Allocations of payroll are made by the carrier and should be explained by the carrier to the insured. Since the PCRB did not perform the audit, the PCRB does not normally have the relevant facts on which to base an opinion or render a decision. Issues/disputes of this kind should initially be referred to the carrier's regional audit manager for resolution

Upon receipt of the written inquiry the PCRB will determine whether the information presented is sufficient to determine the employer's applicable classification. In those cases where the information provided is insufficient, the PCRB will usually schedule the employer for a field survey/special audit or issue a "Description of Operations Questionnaire." Following the field survey/special audit or receipt of the completed questionnaire, the PCRB will issue a written ruling on the matter that will be communicated to authorized parties. These decisions are subject to further review as delineated in the "Appeals from Application of the Rating System Procedure" – Section 1, Rule XVI.

With respect to telephone requests, an official binding PCRB decision on classification/audit matters cannot be provided over the telephone. However, the PCRB will offer opinions as requested. To that end a carrier, agent or employer who telephones the PCRB on a classification/audit question should:

• Identify himself/herself and indicate the firm he/she represents;
• Give the name, address and PCRB file number (if available) of the employer in question;
• Be knowledgeable of the facts surrounding the situation and prepared to provide specific responses to
  any questions asked.

Please remember the PCRB is in a position to reply only to an employer, the authorized agent or carrier-of- record
or another representative of the employer relative to the employer's account (providing the PCRB has received a
signed, recently-dated letter on the employer's letterhead authorizing the representative to act on the employer's
behalf in the matter at issue).

## CLEARING OF LAND

Below find the class assigned to payroll developed in each of four different but common types of land clearing or
right-of-way clearing or maintenance projects. Such class listing does not waive either the underwriting or payroll
division rules delineated in Sections 1 or 2 of this Manual.

1. Assign Code 009 for tree cutting/felling by chain saw regardless of tree size and the incident removal of
   brush and/or stumps.

2. Assign Code 015 for tree cutting/felling by mechanized equipment regardless of tree size and the
   incident removal of brush and/or stumps.

3. Assign Code 609 for all methods of clearing or removing brush and/or stump removal not incident to tree
   removal including road construction.

4. Assign Code 005 for all methods of tree pruning, spraying (except aerial tree spraying, which is
   assignable to the applicable aircraft operation class) or trimming, including incident tree removal and all
   incident operations.

5. Assign Code 012 for brush or weed control using chemicals dispensed from portable or mechanical
   ground spraying equipment.

## COMMISSION SALESPERSONS (Deductible Expenses)

Commissions paid to commission salespersons shall be included in the audit of payroll for premium computation
purposes, except that traveling and all other expenses of the salespersons in connection with their employment
may be deducted provided the salespersons report such expenses and the insured maintains a definite verifiable
record of them. Arbitrary flat percentages shall not be allowed under the provisions of this interpretation nor shall
automobile depreciation be deductible as an item of expense unless such depreciation comprises a part of the
mileage rate allowance.

## COMPUTER AND/OR SOFTWARE CONSULTING BUSINESSES

A business principally engaged in computer and/or software consulting is assignable to Code 951 and to Code
953 as each classification may apply pursuant to the job duties of individual personnel of such businesses.

One typical workday scenario for computer and/or software consulting staff is the consultant leaves his/her place of
residence in the morning and travels to a customer's location, where the consultant will spend his/her entire day
working on the customer's computer and/or software issues. At the end of the workday the consultant leaves the
customer's location and returns to his/her place of residence. The duration or timing of such an assignment may
vary from one to several days to indefinite. Such persons do not engage in over-the-road sales solicitation or
collection work. As this is no different in relation to the typical workday for a computer person employed directly by
the customer, the assignment of such consultant's payroll is to Code 953.

PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS COMPENSATION MANUAL
Effective: July 1, 2023                                                                                    Section 2
Page 291                                                                                                   CLASSIFICATIONS

In the event a computer and/or software consultant typically visits two or more customer locations in a typical
workday, such separate consultant's payroll is assignable to Code 951.

If the employer cannot or will not provide a sufficiently detailed picture of a computer and/or software consultant's
typical workday so the above procedure may properly be utilized, then the payroll of the consultant(s) shall be
assigned to Code 951.

The above classification procedure is also applicable to separate staff training a customer's staff in the use of
software developed or purchased by the insurer employer for their customer(s).

## DRIVERS (Payroll Allocation)

It is the PCRB's position that the payroll of drivers, chauffeurs or their helpers which cannot be allocated to a
specific classification because they have duties common to more than one classification shall be assigned to the
governing classification of the two or more classifications to which their work belongs.

The above ruling does not supersede any Manual rules found in Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Manual, nor does it
supersede any Manual wording footnotes found in Section 2 regarding the allocation of payroll for the 800- series
of classifications (Trucking and Storage Industry).

Example:

Insured X has approved classifications Code 0034, Animal Raising, and Code 865, Poultry and/or Fish
Dealer/Processor. If insured X had separate crews of drivers that did not interchange their duties between
the two operations, the separate crews would have their payroll allocated to the separate respective
classifications.

If no such separate crew existed and the drivers, etc. have duties common to both operations, their payroll
would be assigned to the governing classification exclusive of miscellaneous employee payroll.

## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS - CLASSIFICATION ASSIGNMENT

A significant number of disputes occur as a result of the misclassification of executive officers' payroll. In an
attempt to enhance the accuracy and consistency of the treatment of these issues by insurance companies, below
find a series of questions that the PCRB believes will aid in the determination of the proper classification for
executive officers:

- Who are the officers of the corporation for the policy period in question?
- Was each of these officers active in the business during the policy period in question?
- What were each officer's exact job duties?
- How many hours a week (or what percentage of time) does each officer work in the store, shop, job site,
  farm, etc.?
- How many hours a week (or what percentage of time) does each officer spend in the basic classification
  work area, providing direct supervision and/or giving instructions to employees?
- How many hours a week (or what percentage of time) does each officer spend out of the office for sales
  calls, meetings or other similar purposes?

Please also see Section 1, Rule IX, Paragraph A., 5. "Assignment of Payroll" that advises an executive officer shall
be classified in the same manner as any employee. Also please see the "Regular and Frequent" entry in the
General Auditing & Classification Information section.

Page 292                                                                                                   CLASSIFICATIONS

## EXECUTIVE SUPERVISORS - CONSTRUCTION OR ERECTION - 951

The assignment of Code 951 is applicable only to executive supervisors who do not exercise direct supervision of construction or erection operations. Code 951 is not applicable to supervisors permanently located at a given job location until the completion of that job. Code 951 is also not assigned to the payroll of any individual who is directly in charge of construction workers (including general laborers) at a specific job location. Any person who is directly in charge of construction work or construction employees at a specific job location shall be assigned to that job classification or, if more than one classification is assigned, to the highest-rated classification for that job if separate payroll records are not maintained.

The job duties of an executive supervisor would include time spent in an office and visits to a job site. Such supervision given by an individual classified under Code 951 must be indirect; i.e., through another person such as a superintendent or foreman. The executive supervisor has overall managerial responsibility for the various projects. That responsibility may include making arrangements for the procurement of materials and/or the delivery of supplies, procurement of subcontractors, maintenance of construction timetables, visits to job sites to keep track of job progress, conferring with clients, architects and engineers, and traveling to and from the company's headquarters. It also contemplates clerical office exposure and the part-time hazards of walking and climbing around on job sites. Typically, the use of the classification is applicable to large construction companies that have at least one level of supervision between the executive supervisor and the worker. It is also applicable in situations where numerous smaller projects are in progress simultaneously and the executive supervisor has the managerial responsibility for all of them.

An exception to the above-stated application would apply to a job superintendent responsible for and physically located at a specific job site where all operations are subcontracted to unrelated concerns. In this instance, the contractor has no construction workers at the job site, and the superintendent cannot exercise direct control of the subcontractor's employees. Therefore, in this circumstance the job superintendent should have his/her pay- roll assigned to Code 951.

## FROZEN OR FROSTED FOOD PRODUCTS MFG.

The processing of frozen foods shall be assigned to the classification which would apply if the product was not frozen. This ruling is made as the application of cold to either chill or freeze food products is common to a number of food processing classifications. It has been determined that the freezing operations of themselves do not change the fundamental characteristics of the risk.

## HOTEL OR MOTEL OPERATIONS

The two classifications applicable to hotel/motel operations are Codes 973 and 945.

Code 973 shall include all operations performed by hotel or motel employees except for separate food service and beverage staff(s). Employees assigned to Code 973 include but are not necessarily limited to: front desk employees, persons engaged in the operation of newsstands, candy or cigar shops or similar activities, personnel operating or maintaining indoor or outdoor swimming pools, the golf course(s), video game room, the health or fitness club, tennis courts or other hotel or motel guest amenities, maids, housemen, inside or outside maintenance, store workers, barbers, laundry workers, employees performing concierge services (i.e., arrangements for tours, theater tickets or the rental of automobiles), or opening boxes and/or bags and laying out pre-packaged food or beverages and/or precooked food (including heating of the precooked foods in a microwave oven) and/or making coffee for a continental breakfast where there is no other food service or beverage operations.

Separate staff exclusively engaged in the hotel's food service or beverage operations shall be classified by Code 945 which includes but is not necessarily limited to: waiters or waitresses and their assistants, cooks, kitchen help, bartenders, cashiers, restaurant managers, musicians or entertainers. On the auditing procedures for tips and musicians or entertainers, see Section 1, Rule V.

Payroll developed by interchanging hotel and hotel restaurant employees shall be assigned to Code 973 or to
Code 945, whichever has the higher value.

## OPERATIONS ALSO INCLUDED:

1. Religious retreats.
2. Temporary or short term lodging facilities for families of seriously ill or injured children who are
   hospitalized (e.g., a Ronald McDonald House).

## OPERATIONS NOT INCLUDED:

1. Please refer to the Ski Resorts entry in the General Auditing & Classification Information section
   for the classification procedure for such businesses.
2. The businesses of a concessionaire or independent contractor operating on the premises of a
   hotel or motel will be classified on the merits of their operations.
3. Assign Code 953 to employees of the hotel or hotel restaurant exclusively engaged in clerical
   office duties.
4. Assign Code 981 to payroll developed by slot machine gambling operations when conducted in a
   physically separate department by a separate staff.

## INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR, OWNER/OPERATOR OR EMPLOYEE

### Determinations of Premium Obligations Where Questions of Workers' Compensation Coverage Status Arise

Questions involving whether a person is an independent contractor, owner/operator or employee fall into an area
of law for which consideration of many factors is potentially required in order to consider their entitlement to
workers' compensation benefits. The Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau (PCRB) does not make and has
no authority to make determinations regarding the entitlement of any person(s) to workers' compensation benefits
arising out of the course of activities related to any business or other entity, whether any such person has or has
not been injured in the course of such activity. However, the PCRB will exercise authority over the issue of
whether or not premiums are due for an individual(s) whose workers' compensation coverage status is questioned.
This authority is different from finding independent contractor, owner/operator or employee status and is also
different from establishing eligibility/ineligibility for benefits arising out of an accident or disease that has occurred
or may occur, determinations which the PCRB specifically cannot render. The PCRB's procedure in making
determinations regarding premium obligations is as follows:

A carrier insuring an entity to which a sole proprietor, partner, corporate officer or LLC member provides
services as a subcontractor may not collect premium from the insured entity for that subcontractor if the
subcontractor has or had a standard workers' compensation insurance policy covering the
subcontractor for the entire period during which services were provided.

Further, a carrier insuring an entity to which a person provides services as a subcontractor may not
collect premium for that person if the subcontractor is working in the capacity of an officer of a
corporation in providing such services and has executed a written election not to be subject to the
Workers' Compensation Act.

A carrier insuring an entity to which a person provides services as a subcontractor which does not meet
either of the above criteria precluding collection of premium may either waive or collect premium from the
insured entity for that subcontractor. Carrier decisions to waive or collect premium in such instances may
consider a variety of factors, such as but not necessarily including or limited to the right of direction and
control of the subcontractor by the entity to which services are provided, whether or not the
subcontractor maintains general liability insurance coverage applicable to the services being provided or
the possibility that the subcontractor may have additional workers. Carrier decisions in such regard are
not subject to review by the PCRB.

## MANUFACTURED (MOBILE) HOME VS. MODULAR HOME

Both a manufactured (mobile) home and a modular home are produced in a factory, but there are differences between each type of home. The manufactured/mobile home is towed on a permanent steel chassis, which remains a structural part of the home throughout its service life. It has a non-removable steel chassis, while a modular home does not. Although required to be secured to the ground, the manufactured home retains its permanent steel chassis, and, thus, while many are not relocated, a manufactured home may be relocated and is considered removable and relocatable.

A modular home is transported to the installation site on a flat-bed truck. Modular homes are placed upon foundations, often with the use of a crane. Modular homes are not relocatable and are considered a permanent structure once placed upon a foundation.

The production of a manufactured/mobile home is assigned to Code 451. Code 305 is used to classify the production of a modular home.

Assign Code 818 to a manufactured home setup or warranty service, whether by the dealer or a specialist contractor.

Assign Code 652 to modular home setup, warranty service, remodeling, or repair, whether by the dealer or a specialist contractor.

## MINIMUM WAGE PROCEDURE

Section 1, Rule V., B. 2. o. Of the Manual remuneration includes: Adjustments necessary to bring employees to the federal minimum wage as reported by the United States Department of Labor.

Section 1, Rule V., B. 3. e. of the Manual remuneration excludes: tips and other gratuities received by employees.

All carriers are required to include an adjustment to equal the current federal minimum wage. The auditor should verify if all employees' wages equal or exceed the federal minimum wage. If not, the following adjustments should be made, assuming the current minimum hourly wage for tipped employees is included.

1. Determine the average number of full-time tipped employees and the normal work hours.

   - 35 hour week x (the difference of federal minimum wage and the tipped employees' minimum wages) x number of tipped employees x 52 weeks.

2. Determine the average number of part-time tipped employees and the normal work hours.

   - Number of hours x (the difference of federal minimum wage and the tipped employee minimum) x the number of tipped employees x 52 weeks.

## NURSING HOME, PERSONAL CARE HOME AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES

The following guidelines have been developed to aid in the classification of employees of a typical nursing home/personal care home. Proper documentation on audit worksheets should be added whenever exceptions are made to these guidelines. These guidelines, to varying degrees, affect the following basic business classifications:

Code 960, NURSING AND CONVALESCENT HOME
Code 974, RETIREMENT OR LIFE CARE COMMUNITY
Code 979, RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR THE ELDERLY – NON MEDICAL

# PENNSYLVANIA WORKERS COMPENSATION MANUAL
Effective: July 1, 2023                                                                                    Section 2
Page 295                                                                                                   CLASSIFICATIONS

Nursing home/personal care home employees do not have to provide actual "hands on" care to the patients and/or residents in order to have their payroll assigned to one of the above basic classifications. The object of the classification system is to group insureds into classifications so that the rating value for each classification reflects the exposures common to such distinct business enterprise (See Section 1, Rule IV. C. 2. and 3.). It is the business of the insured that is classified within Pennsylvania, not the separate employments, occupations or operations within the business.

Employees who typically comprise the basic classification for a nursing home/personal care home are activity staff, beauticians or barbers (usually remunerated through a 1099), dining room set-up and servers, drivers, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance/plant including supervisors, nurses (registered nurses, licensed practical nurses), nurses' aides including certified nurses' aides, security and therapists (physical and speech).

Employees typically considered office employees include accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivable, business office, bookkeeping, finance, human resources and the office manager. These employees must work in a physically separate office as defined in Section 1, Rule IV, B. 2.

Codes 960, 974 and 979 are "all employees except office," which means none of the three classes permit payroll division with Code 951, Outside Sales.

With the above statements in mind, the payroll of nursing home/personal care home employees should be assigned in the following manner.

## ADMINISTRATOR/EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

Each facility has a licensed nursing home or residential care facility administrator on site that is in charge of all operations at the facility. This employee prepares budgets, reviews departmental reports, answers questions of department managers, deals with licensing issues, handles public relation issues, attends community events to promote the business, deals with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act) regulations, deals with employee benefits, handles safety issues, interprets procedures and writes plans of correction based on inspection reports. The employee will attend patient care plan meetings. The administrator will make rounds of the facility on a regularly scheduled basis. Each round will vary as to the amount of time it takes depending on the size and complexity of the facility. During rounds, the administrator walks the halls to observe that the patients are being cared for properly, there are no unreported maintenance issues, no housekeeping issues that are unsolved, the floor has adequate staffing and the general appearance of the facility is acceptable.

The administrator will stop and talk to residents to inquire if they have any complaints or concerns and will talk to family members and volunteers who may have questions. The administrator will not provide direct patient care. By state law (for nursing homes only) the administrator is not permitted to feed, toilet, administer medications or provide any other type of care. However, administrators do keep track of how often nurses see patients.

Administrators should have their payroll assigned to the applicable basic classification, as they are regularly exposed to the operative hazards of the nursing home/personal care facility. An administrator's job duties fall beyond the Manual definition of a clerical office employee.

## ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR

An assistant administrator performs many of the same job duties as the administrator and reports directly to the administrator in the chain of command. This employee may assist the administrator in the preparation of budgets, review departmental reports, answer questions of department managers, deal with licensing issues, handle public relation issues, attend community events to promote the business, deal with HIPPA regulations, deal with employee benefits, handle safety issues, interpret procedures and write plans of correction based on inspection reports. The employee will attend patient care plan meetings. The assistant administrator may make rounds of the facility on a regularly scheduled basis. Each round will vary as to the amount of time it takes depending on the size and complexity of the facility.

Page 296                                                                                                    CLASSIFICATIONS

During rounds, the assistant administrator may walk the halls to observe that the patients are being cared for properly. They make sure no restraints are being used, there are no unreported maintenance issues or housekeeping issues that are unsolved, the floor is adequately staffed, and the general appearance of the facility is acceptable.

The assistant administrator may stop and talk to residents to inquire if they have any complaints or concerns and may talk to family members and volunteers who have questions. The assistant administrator may or may not provide direct patient care. Assistant administrators should have their payroll assigned to the appropriate basic classification, as they are regularly exposed to the operative hazards of the nursing home/personal care facility. See the Regular and Frequent Ruling and Interpretation for the definitions of "regular and frequent." An assistant administrator's job duties fall beyond the Manual definition of a clerical office employee.

## ACTIVITY DIRECTOR

The activity director is in charge of the recreational and educational activities at a nursing home. The director is responsible for setting up a schedule, ordering supplies for the activities and, in some of the smaller homes, directly supervising the employees and residents in activities. If the activities director has a physically separate office, does not participate nor directly supervise (this activity may be done by the assistant activity director) and has no regular job duties in or about the facility, then the employee may have their payroll assigned to the clerical office classification. However, most activity directors are responsible for organizing and directly supervising the event and are present at the activity, whether it is on the premises of the facility or at another location (e.g., a shopping trip to a local mall). As such, the payroll of an activity director is generally assignable to the basic classification.

## ADMISSIONS DIRECTOR

The admissions director may have alternate job titles such as marketing director, social services director, public relations director or director of development. Regardless, this employee is responsible for working with residents and their families and guiding them through the admission process. The admissions director will explain facility rules (such as marking clothing with a name) and patients' rights. The employee will work with family members who wish to bring furniture from home. The admissions director may explain that all electrical appliances must be inspected for safety (no frayed wires). If a family member visits and removes money from the patient, the admissions director must determine if an abuse situation exists and deal with reporting suspected abuse. If a patient is not happy with his room or roommate, the admissions director will determine if the patient can be transferred to another room. The admissions director may coordinate family concerns with department heads. If two family members disagree about treatment or how a resident's money is being spent, the admissions director may intervene and mediate the situation. They may do the charting about the social interactions of residents. They will plan care meetings. If a patient passes away or moves to another facility, the admissions director may contact the family about collecting personal belongings. They may also work with the ombudsman (a representative from the Area Agency on Aging that is assigned to a nursing home). The payroll of an admissions director is usually assigned to the basic classification, as they regularly spend time in and about the facility even though their primary job duties keep them in a physically separate office.

## CASE MANAGER

This position is responsible for the management of the rehabilitation department. The employee directs the therapists and gathers information on the level of care needed for minimum data sets (MDS) forms. The case manager maintains the resident's logs and compares the amount of therapy provided to the resident's care plan. The case manager usually does not provide any rehabilitation services. This employee may go to the local hospital to screen charts for potential admissions. The case manager deals with discharge personnel in hospitals regarding possible admissions to their facility. While at the nursing home, the case manager attends managed therapy meetings to see that therapy provided to a resident is in compliance with Medicare regulations. The employee prepares communications bulletins and may write articles for a news bulletin that is distributed to residents. The case manager meets with physicians and social service workers to determine if any residents in the assisted living facility need to be moved to the nursing home. The employee is responsible for "hospitality" when new residents move into the independent living cottages, if such a facility exists. The employee will go to the resident's apartment and visit with the resident, answering any questions while providing information about the facility.

The case manager's payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## CENTRAL SUPPLY CLERK

This employee is responsible for distributing supplies to the floors and assuring the cupboards are stocked with needed supplies. This employee orders the supplies and determines what is chargeable to a resident. The employee will physically stock the supplies in the units. Some facilities title these employees as purchasing, but they work in an area similar to a storage office. They will make deliveries of supplies throughout the facility, and their control/purchasing is confined to a computer, paperwork or reports. Their offices are usually locked, since this is also where the supplies are located. The central supply clerk's payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## CHAPLAINS

A chaplain is a clergyman in charge of the nursing facility's chapel. They organize and conduct religious services for the residents of the nursing facility. They will visit non-ambulatory and ambulatory facility residents to provide spiritual counseling, individual worship services and counseling or just to see how a resident is faring in the facility. They may conduct in-room communions and/or last rites. Their payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## CLINICAL DIRECTOR

The clinical director's job responsibilities usually involve updating and reviewing the resident's medical and treatment charts and folders. If they review medications and treatments on the floor or in the resident rooms or if their offices are not physically separate from all other areas of the nursing facility, the payroll of the clinical director is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## DIETARY COORDINATOR/DIRECTOR/MANAGER/SUPERVISOR

In some of the larger facilities there is a dietary director/manager who maintains all the dietary requirement records for the residents. Many residents have varying dietary needs, so this is often a critical position. This employee would develop menus and oversee food service. This may entail charting the intake of food by the residents. These duties are performed both in the office and on the floor. The duties also involve supervising the preparation of the food and trays. The employee may directly supervise dietary preparation in the kitchen or walk throughout the facility when meals are served to see that the patient is given their dietary requirements. The payroll of the dietary coordinator/director/ manager is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## DIRECTOR OF NURSING (DON)/ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF NURSING (ADON)

Director of Nursing - This position is usually charged with overseeing the entire nursing/care functions of the facility. This employee is responsible for administering the nursing program to maintain standards of patient care and advises medical staff, department heads and administrators in matters related to nursing service. The employee analyzes and evaluates the quality of care administered by the nursing staff and visits residents routinely. The DON does not do any actual patient care.

Some nursing directors move throughout the facility all of the time, while others less so, spending the majority of their time in the office. This employee performs the scheduling of the nursing staff, all of the interviewing and hiring of nursing staff, and may review the unit manager's work. Due to the nature of the employee's work and the fact that the position requires the visitation of residents and the evaluation of the quality of care administered by the nursing staff, the payroll of the director of nursing is properly assigned to the basic classification.

Assistant Director of Nursing - This position is responsible for directing the programs of the facility. The employee collaborates in composing and implementing nursing policy, practice and quality assurance throughout the nursing department. The employee does not do any actual patient care. Primarily, their job responsibilities center around the quality assurance programs. The ADON makes sure all nursing departments are ready for the state survey. The ADON develops the schedule for quality assurance audits and reports. The employee directs, supervises and assigns projects and programs to a quality assurance analyst. The employee develops and directly oversees the Infection Control Program and reports monthly to the Quality Assurance Committee. The employee may oversee the wound care program and plans, organizes and oversees the staff development program, reviewing the accurate recording of in-service attendance records. The ADON interacts on a regular basis with patients, families, physicians and facility employees and makes tours throughout the facility on a daily basis.

In smaller facilities the ADON is the supervisor on the floor. Their time may be split between directly supervising the registered nurses and other nursing staff and completing paperwork in an office. The payroll of the ADON is properly assigned to the basic classification.

FACILITIES MANAGER

This employee, in most cases, has direct floor duties and can do hands-on repair and maintenance work in and about the facility. This employee will also conduct evaluations for major repairs and improvements to the facility that requires the hiring of outside contractors. The payroll of the facilities manager is properly assigned to the basic classification.

HOME HEALTH AND/OR HOME CARE OPERATIONS

Payroll developed by separate staff(s) performing home health and/or home care services shall be separately classified to either Code 942 or to Code 943 as provided for in the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Manual.

INVENTORY CONTROL COORDINATOR

This employee is responsible for the control and purchasing of hard goods and supplies used throughout the facility. This employee usually has no hands-on responsibilities on the facility floor. They usually make no deliveries of supplies throughout the facility, and their control/ purchasing is confined to data entry, computer-generated reports and related paperwork. The payroll of the inventory control coordinator is properly assigned to Code 953, Office, if their job duties are confined to working in a physically separate office.

MEDICAL DIRECTOR/MEDICAL COORDINATOR

The medical director is usually a physician who is only active on a part-time basis. When he/she is active, the duties are usually visiting patients and making rounds within the nursing home. The payroll of the medical director is properly assigned to the basic classification.

MAINTENANCE DISPATCH

These employees' major job responsibility is to dispatch work assignments to the maintenance employees. These employees are found in larger type facilities. They spend no time performing maintenance work in most facilities. They do not supervise the maintenance employees or do any inspections of the facility. As long as their job duties are confined to working in a physically separate office, their payroll can be assigned to Code 953, Office.

MASHGIAH

A mashgiah is an Orthodox rabbi or a person appointed by such a rabbi whose responsibility is to prevent violations of Jewish dietary laws by inspection of facilities where food assumed to be kosher is prepared for the public. These employees enter the kitchen area of the facility to make sure certain foods are kosher. This job position is usually found in faith-based facilities, and their payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## MEDICAL RECORDS CLERK/WARD CLERK

The medical records clerks are normally responsible for updating resident's charts and medical records. If they spend no time picking up and dropping off charts at either nurses' stations or resident's rooms, assign Code 953. If they perform any of the above duties on a regular basis on the floor, their payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification. If they complete their updates in a physically separate office, their payroll may be assigned to Code 953, Office.

In larger facilities, medical records clerks usually work in the business office and use computers to maintain a database of records. In such circumstances assign Code 953. In the smaller facilities, they may have other duties, including the delivery of medical supplies to nursing stations and interchanging labor as a central supply clerk. If a medical records clerk has any of these duties, then their payroll should be assigned to the basic classification.

## NURSING SECRETARY/SCHEDULER

These employees do the paperwork for the nursing department, such as typing, scheduling, filing and other administrative support job duties. Their payroll may be assigned to Code 953, Office, if they work in a physically separate office and have no floor exposure. If they have their desks at the nursing station that is on the floor, their payroll would be assigned to the basic classification.

## RECEPTIONIST

Receptionists answer incoming telephone calls and direct them to the correct extension. This employee also greets incoming visitors and asks them why they are at the facility. They may direct all visitors to sign a guest register. They may assist staff in making photocopies. They may maintain the postage meter and be responsible for outgoing mail. They will observe resident safety while the resident is in the lobby area. If one of the residents needs assistance or falls while in the lobby area, the receptionist may quickly page an aide to assist the resident rather than walk out to the resident herself. The receptionist will type the necessary information onto a new resident's identification bracelet. They may accept payment from residents or their representatives. They may walk out to the office, lobby and/or solarium to lock up the doors at the close of each day.

Receptionists in a nursing home facility not only greet and direct visitors but also provide a measure of security/safety for wandering residents and for visitors as well. Such an arrangement invariably precludes the assignment of Code 953, Office. Their payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## REGISTERED NURSE ASSESMENT COORDINATOR (RNAC)

These employees are responsible for the completion and accuracy of the resident care planning process and monitoring level-of-care changes and determinations. The RNAC oversees the development and implementation of individual resident care plans and ensures the resident's reaction and ongoing development. They are case managers for the residents and compile all of the paperwork that is needed to deal with the Health Maintenance Organizations that reimburse the nursing home for the treatment and care of the resident. They input all types of information into the computer about the activity level of all of the residents. They complete forms called Minimum Data Sets (MDS) for each new admission to the facility. They complete MDS reviews on each resident on a quarterly basis, as well as an annual MDS. The form must be completed for each resident at least once a quarter and at other times required by Medicaid, including admission and change in condition.

The RNAC compiles this information by a comprehensive review of the patient charts. The form contains many different sections used to determine how well the resident is able to function. The dietician is responsible for completing the dietary section. The physical therapy department will complete a range of motion study and will complete the appropriate section of the form. The form is a comprehensive form that gathers information about the resident's social skills, communication skills, activities, cognitive skills, nutrition, vision and activities of daily living. Nursing homes are reimbursed by Medicare for the care of a patient based on the condition of the patient. If a patient is in a severe condition and requires extensive medical condition, Medicare will reimburse more funds for that patient than a patient who is more self-sufficient. The RNAC writes up reports to be submitted to Medicare. These employees will visit nurses' stations to discuss the patient's progress with a DON or nursing supervisors.

The RNAC will take the patient's charts back to their office to type up the reports. These individuals will also visit patient rooms to do evaluations.

The amount of time an RNAC spends working throughout the facility varies. An assessment nurse has to assess the patient, and different department heads complete parts of the form, but the RNAC signs off on the form. The RNAC places his/her license at risk by signing a form verifying the data is correct. For example, if a report states a patient has bedsores, the RNAC will go on the floor and physically turn the patient over to verify this is correct. Direct observation of the resident, as well as communication with the resident's direct caregivers across all shifts, are essential for the RNAC to complete their job according to the Resident Assessment Instrument User's Manual, a manual issued by the Federal government regarding the MDS. Based on the above information and job duties, the payroll of RNACs is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## RESTORATIVE PROGRAMS DIRECTOR

This employee is responsible for making sure that the residents eat regularly, walk and engage in the therapy that is provided by the insured's restorative aides. The employee will go out to see the residents and test them and regularly walks around the facility. Part of the employee's job responsibilities requires the employee to walk, lift and bend. The restorative programs director directly supervises the restorative aides and reviews them doing their jobs. Their payroll is assigned to the basic classification.

## STAFF DEVELOPMENT/IN-SERVICE TRAINING COORDINATOR

These employees are registered nurses and are the "clinical experts." When a new employee is hired, these employees will do an orientation with the employee. They review corporate compliance, explain workers' compensation and infection control, and introduce the employee to his manager. They verify that all forms are completed as required for the new hire. They attend "stand-up meetings." These are meetings that occur at the change of a shift. The employees completing their shift will explain any changes in a resident's condition to the new shift. These meetings used to take place at the nursing station, but, due to HIPPA regulations, they are now held in an activity room.

They are responsible for assuring the staff's credentials and licenses are up-to-date. They assure nurses have the correct number of continuing education credits. They arrange for educational classes to be provided to employees. They may arrange for the maintenance department to provide information in a classroom setting on fire safety and the correct operation of a fire extinguisher. They may arrange for housekeeping to conduct a class for staff on infection control. They will gather information from the floor supervisors verifying nurses have met IV competencies (inserted the correct number of IVs successfully in the correct amount of time).

They regularly spend time doing classroom teaching of employees. They will teach and provide instruction classes on hand-washing techniques, resident safety, wound care and proper lifting mechanics. Their payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

## STAFF COORDINATOR

This employee would only work from their office completing staffing schedules for the various departments. Their main job duty is to make sure there are enough employees for each shift.

If they have no other job duties and their scheduling work is done in a physically separate office, then the payroll of these employees may be assigned to Code 953, Office.

## TRANSPORTATION DISPATCHER

Some of the larger facilities have employees who sit in an office and schedule transportation for the residents for shopping, doctors' visits and family visits. If the employee has no other job duty and their scheduling work is done in a physically separate office, then their payroll may be assigned to Code 953, Office. If the employee regularly engages in driving the residents to and from their destinations, their payroll is properly assigned to the basic classification.

UTILIZATION MEDICAL REVIEWER

These individuals review charts from medical records for the doctors to determine patient medical needs.

These individuals work in enclosed offices and usually have no floor duties. If their work is done in a physically
separate office, then the payroll of these employees may be assigned to Code 953, Office.

UNIT CLERK/SECRETARY

This employee is responsible for ordering supplies for the nursing department and checking secretarial notes for
quality. The unit clerk will code bills for insurance companies, Medicare and Medicaid. These employees may work
on the nursing home floor at a desk behind the nursing stations, or they may work in a physically separate office.
Their responsibilities include maintaining all unit records of the patient residents. The employee answers, the
phones, schedules medical appointments for residents on the unit and marks files if a resident leave the facility.
The employee coordinates all labs and doctor appointments by telephone.

They call for transportation for all of the appointments and perform chart-thinning work according to the nursing
home's policy. They maintain all forms and active files and coordinate all lab orders by telephone. They fax
paperwork to pharmacies and physicians and complete admission/readmission checklists for each admission.

This employee is responsible for the secretarial work on the unit. The employee assures doctor's orders are
placed in the patient's chart. The employee may work at a desk in the nursing station on the floor or may be in a
physically separate office. If the employee has no regular job duties on the nursing room floor and works in a
physically separate office, then their payroll may be assigned to Code 953, Office. If they work on the nursing
home floor at a desk behind the nursing station, then their payroll should be assigned to the basic classification

VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR

The coordinator who has no duties/supervisory responsibilities over the volunteers on the floor, who simply
schedules and coordinates volunteers' activities, can be classified as clerical. They usually work in an enclosed
office. Many coordinators simply spend their time on the telephone recruiting volunteers or asking them to come in
on a particular day. If they have no regular job duties in or about the facility and they work in a physically separate
office, their payroll should be assigned to Code 953. Those volunteer coordinators who supervise volunteers on
the floor should have their payroll assigned to the basic classification.

PER DIEMS

Per Diems refer to a specific amount of money that a business provides to an employee to cover living and
traveling expenses in connection with work. To the extent that specific documentation is not available for
substantiation of per diem expenses in accordance with Manual rules (see Section 1, Rule V, and F.) per diem
expense reimbursement payments are included as remuneration for premium computation purposes.

Certain Internal Revenue Service (IRS) procedures allow for employer deduction of per diems paid to employees
under the terms of a "nonaccountable plan." This type of plan does not require actual receipts for the expenses
covered by the per diems. Exclusion of per diems under a "nonaccountable plan" from remuneration for premium
computation purposes is solely a matter for carrier review and determination. Disputes emanating from insuring
carrier's determinations in the area of nonaccountable IRS per diem plans are not subject to PCRB review and
resolution.

Effective: July 1, 2023                                                                                   Section 2
Page 302                                                                                                  CLASSIFICATIONS

Code 608 is applicable to the building of concrete flooring or padding for one or two-story structures. Code 609 is applicable to site preparation and to any excavation. Code 654 is the proper classification for the building of concrete flooring or padding for structures of three stories or higher. Payroll developed in the erection of the prefabricated metal building framework is assignable to Code 655. Installation of sheet metal siding, roofing or interior work for a prefabricated metal building or the erection of metal or fiberglass silo sections is assignable to Code 651. Electrical work is assignable to Code 661 and plumbing installation is assignable to Code 663. For the silo erection Code 675 is proper for payroll developed in the installation of conveyors or other materials handling equipment or for the service and/or repair of such. Other trade classifications may be extended as warranted.

## PREVAILING WAGE PAYMENTS

Prevailing wage statutes, including but not necessarily limited to the Davis-Bacon Act or the Pennsylvania Prevailing Wage Act stipulate that contractors under Federal or State government contracts, respectively, are required to pay specific minimum wage rates and specified fringe benefits. When auditing these types of employers, all wages paid to the employees are included for premium calculation. Fringe benefits that are required may only be excluded from premium calculation when paid to group insurance plans, pension plans or third party administrators. If fringe benefit payments are paid directly to an employee the fringe benefit amount is treated like wages and is included for premium calculation.

## PRODUCT ASSEMBLY DEFINITION

For classification purposes, the term "assembly" refers to the joining together of prefabricated component parts purchased from unrelated concerns to form a described product. Some portion of the purchased prefabricated component parts may be modified prior to assembly. When a specific assembly classification does not exist for a certain product, the assembly of such product shall be assigned to the manufacturing classification which most accurately describes the completed product.

It is common for stores, such as those engaged in the sale of bicycles, furniture, jewelry or light fixtures, to perform incidental assembly activities in preparation for the display of or after the sale of merchandise. Assembly or "get ready" activities which are incidental to a store's operations shall be assigned to the store's applicable classification.

## PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FIRMS

Property management firms are engaged in the management of real property which may be owned by the management firm or owned by unrelated businesses and managed under contract. Real property is defined for this Ruling and Interpretation as apartment houses, condominiums, private dwellings (houses) and commercial office buildings. The duties of a property management firm are to enforce the provisions of the lease agreement entered into by the tenant and landlord, to ensure that necessary tax, mortgage, insurance and other payments are made in a timely manner, and to ensure that the property is maintained in such a way as to maximize its value to the owner. In the conduct of such operations management companies may employ maintenance personnel, resident or on-site managers, leasing agents or property management supervisors or may subcontract all or portions of these separate responsibilities. The basic functions performed by the personnel of property management firms and the current classification procedures followed in connection therewith are presented below:

### Maintenance

Maintenance personnel generally perform minor maintenance and repair work at the property site, including but not limited to: cutting the grass, shoveling snow, plumbing, electrical wiring, painting and minor carpentry activities. New construction or structural alterations generally are subcontracted to a specialty contractor. Payroll developed by maintenance employees of a commercial or industrial building owner, lessee or real estate management firm is assigned to Code 971. Payroll developed by maintenance employees of an apartment or condominium complex operator is assigned to Code 880.

Page 303                                                                                                  CLASSIFICATIONS

## Resident or On-Site Managers

Resident managers typically are retained in connection with residential apartment complexes, while on-site managers may be employed in connection with either residential or commercial properties. Resident managers usually receive compensation in the form of a salary and an apartment unit located at the site of the managed property. The duties of resident or on-site managers retained in connection with apartment complexes and similar multiple dwelling units may include but are not limited to: performing maintenance and repair work, showing apartments to prospective tenants, preparing lease or rental agreements, collecting rents, handling tenant complaints, inspecting vacated units for damage, coordinating maintenance and repair activities, acting as the liaison between tenants and management supervisors, and directly supervising the overall operations and/or maintenance staff of the property.

As a general rule, managers engaged in the above job duties should have their payroll assigned to either Code 971 or Code 880. However, managers who perform no maintenance/repair work or perform no direct super- vision of the maintenance staff or do not supervise the overall operations of the complex may have their payroll assigned to Code 951. The duties of on-site managers retained in connection with commercial buildings are similar to those described above and are classified the same way.

## Leasing Agents

Leasing agents are typically engaged in residential and/or commercial property leasing or real estate sales activities. Leasing agents are paid a commission based upon the total rent paid over the duration of the lease. Leasing agents show available space to prospective tenants and negotiate the terms of the lease, including the lease period, tenant improvements, payment schedules, and termination provisions. Leasing agents usually do not perform any property management activities.

Historically, leasing agents engaged exclusively in the aforementioned activities have been assigned to Code 951. Leasing agents who, in addition to leasing activities, perform property management operations, such as the direct supervision of employees engaged in the operation, maintenance or repair of properties, are assignable to either Code 971 or Code 880.

## Property Management Supervisors

Property management supervisors normally retain responsibility for several residential complexes, single-family residences and/or commercial buildings. Such persons primarily perform administrative duties in the office of the management firm but will also visit the various properties under management to ensure that the properties are being adequately maintained. The job duties of these employees involve entering into contractual arrangements with real estate property owners for the management of properties, obtaining new properties to be managed, negotiating contracts with firms specializing in the maintenance, repair or alteration of properties, hiring and dismissal of resident or on-site managers, handling the financial arrangements of the property, preparing financial reports, showing available space to potential tenants, renegotiating or extending leases, meeting with resident or on-site managers to discuss problems or complaints, periodically inspecting the physical appearance of the property to ensure that necessary maintenance and repair operations are being performed and to take note of additional needed repairs.

Property management supervisors do not:

- reside at or work from the site of the properties under management
- directly supervise maintenance or repair employees
- directly supervise the operation of the property

Employees exclusively engaged in the above job duties may have their payroll assigned to Code 951.

Page 304                                                                                                   CLASSIFICATIONS

OPERATIONS NOT INCLUDED:

1. The management or operation of all other types of real property is not subject to this Ruling and
   Interpretation and shall be classified as provided elsewhere in this Manual.

## REGULAR AND FREQUENT

In determining the classification assignment for an employee who may have (to varying degrees) multiple
operational exposures, the term "regular and frequent" has historically been used by the PCRB in evaluating the
duties of the employee(s) in question. The purpose of this R&I is to briefly (but not exhaustively) clarify the PCRB's
use and application of this classification assignment concept.

The word "regular" is defined as "usual, normal, customary, recurring at fixed times and periodic." The word
"frequent" is defined as "happening or occurring at short intervals, constant or habitual." The intent of the PCRB's
classification procedure is to assign the payroll of an employee having multiple occupational exposures to that
classification most consistent with the overall nature of that employee's exposure. The term "regular and frequent"
is a benchmark used to help determine whether exposure in a given occupational area is or is not sufficient to
warrant assignment of an employee to the Manual classification applicable to such exposure.

An employee need not actually work at a production machine in order to have their payroll assigned to the
appropriate basic production classification. If, in the course of performing their work, the employees' duties bring
them into regular and frequent contact with the production area, then that person's payroll would be assigned to
the appropriate basic production classification.

The above observation should not be construed to mean that any individual who ever steps into the plant or shop
area would automatically have their payroll assigned to the higher valued classification. The intent of the PCRB's
classification procedure is to be reasonable and fair in assigning the appropriate classification that reflects the
employee's job duties. Therefore, an employee who was temporarily engaged in a job duty beyond the restrictive
definition of the standard exception classifications on an infrequent or emergency basis would not have their
payroll assigned to the basic classification.

Please note that the existence of a portal door or window in a floor-to-ceiling partition to allow an interface between
employees, visitors or customers does not in and of itself invalidate the floor-to-ceiling partition.

Some examples may further clarify these considerations:

- Employee X of ABC Corporation makes outside sales calls and visits prospective customers one day a
  week every week. The employee will typically visit five to six customers. The other four days of the
  week, Employee X works at ABC Corporation's offices handling administrative paperwork and other
  clerical duties. Employee X's payroll would be allocated to Code 951, because this employee is regularly
  (every week) and frequently (one day per week) engaged in outside sales duties away from the
  premises.

- Employee X of ABC Corporation makes a trip to a sales convention for a week, two times a year. The
  rest of the employee's duties keep Employee X working strictly in the company's corporate offices.
  Employee X's payroll should be assigned to Code 953, as two sales convention trips a year should not
  be construed as either regular or frequent.

Page 305                                                                                                 CLASSIFICATIONS

• Employee Y of DEF Corporation spends about two hours (out of an eight-hour day) every day in the production plant. Employee Y will go to each of the production areas of the plant and physically observe and talk with foremen and workers at their machines to get feedback as to when a certain job will be completed. Employee Y may also set up a complex job on a machine or do an emergency repair during these two hours. Employee Y spends the other six hours of each day in an office handling production scheduling, administrative paperwork, finances and management reports. Employee Y's payroll would be assigned to the production plant's governing classification, as this employee is regularly and frequently exposed to the production area, even though Employee Y does not actually work on a production machine.

If this employee had spent only 10-to-15 minutes once or twice a week in the shop conferring with foremen, greeting employees or had been called into the shop in case of an emergency with the rest of their time spent in an office, then the payroll of Employee Y would be assigned to Code 953, as the employee is not frequently in the shop.

The major points attempted to be made here are:

• Determining the amount of time an employee spends exposed to the operational hazards of the business is extremely important.

• Determining the duties of an employee during that time may give a clearer picture of the extent of the employee's duties.

As usual, the more involved in presenting and exploring a line of questioning, the more information comes to light. With the benefit of such enhanced information, the auditor will more likely be able to make an informed judgment on assignment of payroll.

## RETAIL STORE WITH MANUFACTURING CONCERN

Where a retail outlet is located at the same or contiguous premises as a business' manufacturing facility, the applicable retail store classification shall apply to the payroll of the retail outlet provided that such outlet is operated in a work area physically separate from the business' other operations by a floor to ceiling partition and by a separate crew of employees.

## SELF-SERVICE GASOLINE STATIONS AND CONVENIENCE GROCERS

In classifying a combination self-service gasoline station and convenience grocer Code 917 shall apply at each location when the sale of merchandise, other than gasoline, exceeds 10% of the total annual receipts for the location.

Self-service gasoline stations exclusively engaged in the retail sale of gasoline or where the cashier may also sell items such as cigarettes and/or snack food only shall be assigned to Code 816.

## SEPARATE PAYROLL RECORDS – DEFINITION

In limited circumstances, (Section 1, Rule IV, Paragraph C.5), the payroll of an employee may be divided between two or more classifications, provided the employer has maintained the requisite separate payroll records. Specifically, the employer's payroll records should be supported by original time cards, hourly labor postings, labor cost entries or time book entries which show separately, both by individual employee and in summary by operations performed, the remuneration earned by such employee. A standard format for the records is not required but these records must be original and they must be summarized, i.e., totaled, by operation. This allows employers the flexibility to use a variety of methods and technology to record the required information. The accuracy of the summaries must be verifiable by reviewing the original, individual employee records. Data elements must be contemporaneously recorded (originating at the same time) and summarized. If the employer fails to keep complete and accurate records as provided in this definition, the entire remuneration of the employee shall be assigned to the highest valued classification applicable to any part of the work performed by the employee. A permissible payroll separation should be based on a time card(s) or invoice(s) showing the actual number of hours worked for a given employee. Payroll may not be divided by means of percentages, averages, estimates, or any basis other than specific time cards, hourly labor postings, labor cost entries or time book entries.

EXAMPLES:

An employee is engaged in performing the fabrication of iron railings (Code 413) in the shop and also assisting in the installation of ornamental iron railings (Code 658.) The amount of time this employee spends in installing railings should be based on a time card or invoice that show time spent in the installation activity. Usually, an employer uses the total job cost in labor of installation work and transcribes that amount on a separate record (job book, general ledger) for each installation job completed during the workweek. Then the amounts are totaled and recorded on a weekly payroll record or a separate card is completed that just shows the installation payroll. The insured totals the amounts on a weekly or monthly basis.

Other employers record the total hours for each installation by employee for each job and then multiply those hours by the employee's hourly rate. The amount is recorded and entered on a separate section of the employee's earnings card or in the payroll book under the employee's name. This process is also completed week by week with the insured totaling the amounts on a weekly or monthly basis.

Types of records reviewed include but are not limited to payroll records, master control reports, and job cost records.

## SHOP REPAIR OPERATIONS

Risks having shop operations that involve the repair of a product for which there is no repair classification are to be assigned to the classification that applies to the manufacture of the product, unless such repair work is specifically referred to by another classification phraseology, footnote or definition in the Manual.

## SKI RESORTS

A ski resort is a multiple enterprise and the appropriate classification shall be assigned to each of the various operations thereof provided each operation is separately staffed and there is no interchange of employees. Examples of ski resort operations and the applicable classification are listed below:

1. Assign Code 969 to payroll developed in all skiing, snowboarding or snow tubing operations including but not necessarily limited to: the operation of the ski lifts, T-bar, rope tows, snow grooming, operating artificial snow-making machinery, the maintenance of roads or equipment, the transporting of customers to slopes, ski patrols, ski instructors, ticket checkers or sellers, the maintaining of building facilities, security personnel, and parking lot attendants (not for hotel).

2. Assign Code 928 to the operation of shops renting skis, toboggans, boots, poles or other skiing equipment or supplies or engaged in the sale of such merchandise or ski clothing.

3. Assign Code 973 to all payroll developed in the operations of hotel facilities. Please refer to the General
   Auditing & Classification Information entry for "Hotel or Motel Operations" for the scope of the Code 973
   assignment.
4. Payroll developed in the operation of restaurants and/or bar facilities shall be classified as discussed
   below. If the ski resort includes hotel facilities, payroll developed in the restaurant and/or bar
   operation(s) shall be assigned to Code 945. Please refer to the General Auditing & Classification
   Information entry for "Hotel or Motel Operations" for the scope of the Code 945 assignment. Assign the
   applicable restaurant classification in the event the ski resort operates restaurant and/or bar facilities
   and does not have hotel facilities. For further information please refer to the class descriptions of the
   different restaurant classifications (e.g., Codes 897, 975) in Section 2 of this Manual.
5. Assign Code 981 to payroll developed in slot machine gambling operations when conducted in a
   physically separate department by a separate staff.
6. Assign Code 953 to employees engaged in clerical office duties, as defined in Section 1 of this Manual,
   and having no other regular duty in the course of their employment.

## SNOW PLOWING AND/OR REMOVAL

Assign the employer's governing classification to payroll developed in snow plowing and/or removal for unrelated
concerns.

## TEMPORARY STAFFING CONTRACTOR

A temporary staffing contractor hires employees and assigns those employees to an unrelated business for
temporary work assignments in order to supplement the unrelated business' workforce. The duration of temporary
work assignments varies but typically will not exceed one year.

Payroll developed by temporary staff shall be assigned to the applicable temporary staffing classification(s), subject
to the exceptions listed below. To determine the applicable temporary staffing classification(s), identify the direct
employment classification assigned to the client's field of business. Payroll developed by temporary staff provided
to that client is then assigned to the temporary staffing classification corresponding to the client's direct
employment classification. The corresponding temporary staffing classification for each direct employment
classification, where applicable, is identified in the direct employment classification's entry in the Section 2 –
Alphabetic Classification Underwriting Guide.

Exceptions to the general procedure for classifying temporary staffing are as follows:

### EXCEPTIONS

1. AVIATION – temporary staff provided as flight crew in any capacity shall be assigned to the
   applicable direct employment aircraft operation classification.

2. LONGSHORING – temporary staff provided to load or unload vessels shall be assigned to
   the applicable direct employment stevedoring classification.

3. SHIP BUILDING – temporary staff performing either ship building and/or ship repair shall be
   assigned to the applicable direct employment Federal classification.

4. FARM LABOR –temporary staff shall be assigned to the applicable direct employment agricultural
   classification, except for staff provided to perform harvesting, picking and related activities using
   mechanical farming equipment. Such staff shall be assigned to direct employment Code 007.

5. COAL MINING – temporary staff provided to mine coal, to staff a coal breaker, or staff a cleaning
   plant shall be assigned to the applicable Coal Mine Compensation Rating Bureau classification(s).

6. LEASED EMPLOYEES – the leasing of personnel shall not be construed as temporary staffing.

7. CLERICAL – all temporary clerical staff other than telecommuting clerical shall be assigned to Code 2953 regardless of the client's applicable direct employment classification. See Rule IV.B.2 ("Standard Exception Classification") in Section 1 of this Manual for the definition of clerical staff. staff. Telecommuting clerical employees shall be classified to 822. Refer to Code 822 for information regarding the scope of that classification.

8. HOME CARE AND HOME HEALTH CARE – temporary staff performing home health care shall be assigned to the direct employment Code 942 and temporary staff performing home care shall be assigned to direct employment Code 943.

9. The following classifications are not available as a guide in classifying temporary staffing contractors: 822, 906, 972, 985, 989, 993, 994, 996, 0901, 0902, 0908, 0909, 0912 and 0913.

10. WORKFARE PROGRAM EMPLOYEES – assign Code 982 for employable recipients of public assistance delegated by the Department of Public Welfare.

11. PERMANENT STAFF – the permanent staff of a temporary staffing contractor shall be assigned to direct employment Code 951 and direct employment Code 953. See Rules IV.B.4 and 5 for the scope of Codes 951 and 953. Permanent staff of a temporary staffing contractor performing duties that are not included within the definition of either Code 951 or Code 953 shall be assigned to direct employment Code 971.

## TIPS vs. AUTOMATIC GRATUITIES

The IRS has ruled that when a business adds services charges to customers' bills (such as "automatic gratuities") and distributes those charges to its employees, the business should characterize the distributed amounts as social security wages, not as social security tips.

Payments must meet all of the following criteria to be considered as tips:
- The customer must freely determine the payment.
- The customer must be able to determine the amount without restriction.
- The payment cannot be determined by negotiations between the customer and the employer, or dictated by the employer.
- The customer should generally have the right to decide who receives the payment.

Historically, tips, including automatic gratuities, have been excluded from remuneration and, therefore, have been excluded from the basis for premium in Pennsylvania. However, in recognition of this IRS ruling, the PCRB directs that automatic gratuities be included as remuneration. Note that tips, as defined above (and thus distinguished from automatic gratuities), remain an exclusion from remuneration in Pennsylvania.

## TRUCK STOPS

A truck stop establishment is a multiple enterprise, and the appropriate classification shall be assigned to each of the various operations thereof provided each operation is separately staffed and is conducted in a physically separate work area. The exact nature of each of the truck stop's operations will direct which classification to assign. The more common truck stop operations and the assignable class for each are delineated below:

1. Code 816 is for payroll developed by fuel attendants engaged in pumping gasoline or diesel fuel or to personnel who work exclusively on a fuel island adding or changing motor oil, checking the air in tires and performing related duties. Fuel attendants may also accept payment for fuel or motor oil sales.

2. Code 815 is assignable to personnel engaged in the repair of automobiles or trucks. A truck stop may have separate automobile and truck repair bays.

3. Code 973 is assignable to the payroll of chambermaids or related personnel engaged in the upkeep of motel rooms.

Payroll developed in the operation of a restaurant, when conducted in a physically separate department and by a separate crew of employees, including preparing or serving food or beverages, washing dishes or receiving payment for meals or beverages, shall be assigned to the applicable restaurant classification. Please refer to the descriptions of Codes 897 and 975 in Section 2 for further information.

Control desk cashiers' duties include but are not necessarily limited to: operating self-serve fuel pump controls, writing invoices for fuel or motor oil sales or vehicle repairs, receiving cash or credit payment for fuel sales or trucking operating permits, receiving or transmitting telegrams or receiving telegram money transfers, accepting payment for store merchandise or selling lottery tickets. Employees engaged as control desk cashiers may be assigned to Code 928 provided the control desk is located inside the truck stop store. In the event the control desk is located in an enclosed booth located on a fuel island or in an area contiguous thereto the payroll of the control desk cashiers shall be assigned to Code 816.

Additional classifications may be extended to a truck stop in the event a truck stop conducts additional separately staffed and located operations not listed in this General Auditing & Classification Information entry.

## VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND/OR VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANIES – WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE OPTIONS

In Pennsylvania the municipality in which a volunteer fire department(s) and/or volunteer fire company(ies) is based is generally construed to be the statutory employer of the members of the volunteer fire department or volunteer fire company who perform the services of a volunteer firefighter, and for that reason it has been the practice for the municipality in which the volunteer fire department(s) and/or volunteer fire company(ies) is based to provide workers' compensation insurance coverage for such members. The Department of Labor and Industry (Department) has rendered a written opinion on whether a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company may be separately insured pursuant to the Department's review of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Section 601 (a)(1), and the interpretative case law thereon. The Department's opinion states that there is nothing in the language of the Act or the case law accompanying Section 601 (a)(1) that indicates a volunteer fire department and/or company would be prohibited from obtaining a workers' compensation policy separate from that of the municipality in which it is based. In other words, in the Department's opinion a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company may purchase a workers' compensation insurance policy that is separate from the workers' compensation policy of the municipality in which it is based. The Department's opinion also states that the above analysis applies to volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squads, because there is no language in Section 601 (a) (2) or (a) (3) of the Act or in the case law thereon that prohibits a volunteer ambulance corps or a volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad from obtaining workers' compensation insurance separate from the municipality in which it is based.

The classification applicable to a separate workers' compensation insurance policy purchased by a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company for volunteers/members covered by such policy would be Code 994. The classification applicable to a separate workers' compensation insurance policy purchased for the volunteers/ members of a volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad would be Code 993.

If an entity (typically a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company) provides fire, ambulance or rescue and lifesaving squad services in combination and that entity purchases a single, separate workers' compensation policy, then each service provided must be separately classified. In such instances the applicable classifications for the single, separate workers' compensation policy would be both Codes 993 and 994.

If an entity (again typically a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company) has a policy for its employees (e.g., bartenders for a social club or food servers and/or bartenders for a banquet hall), Code 993 and/or Code 994 may be added to that policy for the coverage of the volunteer firefighters and/or volunteer ambulance corps and/or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad persons.

a policy purchased by the municipality in which the volunteer fire department or volunteer fire company and the paid firefighters are based, the municipality's volunteer firefighting premium is prorated pursuant to the procedure delineated in the Section 2 rating value listing pages. The volunteer firefighting premium charge shall be prorated in the same manner in the event a policy separate from the municipality's policy is purchased for the (Code 994) volunteer fire fighting exposure. When ambulance or rescue lifesaving service is provided by an independent, non-municipal entity staffed by a combination of paid ambulance, rescue or lifesaving persons and volunteer ambulance, rescue or lifesaving persons, assign Code 807 to the payroll of the paid ambulance, rescue or lifesaving persons and Code 993 for the volunteers. The Code 993 per corps premium shall be prorated in the same manner cited above for firefighting service provided by the combination of volunteer firefighters and paid firefighters.

## THE MUNICIPALITY IN WHICH A VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT AND/OR VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY IS BASED WILL GENERALLY BE CONSTRUED TO REMAIN THE VOLUNTEERS' STATUTORY EMPLOYER

In the event that a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company does not purchase a separate workers' compensation policy for its volunteers/members or in the event that such separately purchased policy lapses, is canceled or otherwise ceases to be effective for any reason, then the municipality in which the volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company is based should secure workers' compensation insurance coverage for the volunteer fire department's and/or volunteer fire company's volunteers/members. This same provision would also apply to volunteer ambulance corps or rescue or lifesaving squads.

The PCRB expresses no opinion as to the potential liability of a municipality for workers' compensation benefits or otherwise to members of a volunteer fire company, ambulance corps or rescue or lifesaving squad when there exists separate workers' compensation coverage for such members pursuant to another entity's insurance.

## MUNICIPALITY IN WHICH A VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT AND/OR VOLUNTEER FIRE COMPANY IS BASED DEFINED

The term "the municipality in which the volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company is based" shall be defined as any incorporated political subdivision of the Commonwealth smaller than a county (e.g., city, borough, township or town) wherein a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company is headquartered. This definition also applies to volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squads.

In the event of a merger of two or more previously separate volunteer fire departments and/or volunteer fire companies garaged in two or more separately incorporated political subdivisions, the municipality in which a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company is based shall be that participating incorporated political subdivision designated by the parties as the headquarters of the new, merged volunteer fire departments and/or volunteer fire companies. This procedure also applies to merged volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squads.

## SUMMARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY'S (DEPARTMENT) OPINION

The following is a summary of the Department's opinion, and it is based in part on discussions with the Department after the Department issued the opinion. You should not rely on this summary as advice concerning the legal obligation of a person to maintain workers' compensation coverage.

The Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau has asked the Department for an opinion with respect to whether a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company may obtain workers' compensation coverage as an actual employer separate from the coverage of the municipality in which the volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company is based. A second issue is whether a volunteer ambulance corps or a volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad may also pursue workers' compensation coverage separate from the municipality in which it is based. In the Department's opinion a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company or a volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad may separately obtain workers' compensation insurance as an employer independently from the municipality in which it is based.

There is nothing in the language of the Act or the case law accompanying Section 601 (a)(1) of the Act that

Section 2
Page 311
CLASSIFICATIONS

indicates a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company would be prohibited (emphasis in the original) from obtaining workers' compensation coverage separate from the municipality in which such department or company is based. The Commonwealth Court in one case sets forth that "volunteer fire fighters may have two employers for the purposes of the Act, the actual employer under whose supervision the fireman was working at the time of injury, and the statutory employer, i.e. the municipality upon whom rests the responsibility for providing workmen's compensation benefits under Section 601." Temple v. Milmont Fire Co., 525 A.2d 848, 850 (PA Cmwlth. 1987). Even though Temple does not require a volunteer fire department to obtain workers' compensation insurance separate from the municipality in which it is based, it certainly does not prohibit the volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company from doing so as an employer. See id.

The same analysis applies to volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squads – no language in the Act or in the case law accompanying Section 601 (a) (2) or (a) (3) prohibits (emphasis in the original) a volunteer ambulance corps or a volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad from attempting to obtain workers' compensation insurance separate from the municipality in which such corps or squad is based. The only indication the Department found that a volunteer ambulance corps or a volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad and a volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire company would be treated differently in some respect is found in Scrima v. Swissvale Area Emergency Services, 599 A.2d 301 (Pa Cmwlth. 1991). The Commonwealth Court in Scrima declined to expand the rule that volunteer fire department and/or volunteer fire companies are entitled to governmental immunity to include volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squads. However, the fact that governmental immunity cannot be applied to a volunteer ambulance corps or a volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad does not prohibit the volunteer ambulance corps or the volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad from obtaining workers' compensation separate from the workers' compensation coverage of the municipality in which the volunteer ambulance corps or the volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad is based. It may even provide an additional argument in support of why a volunteer ambulance corps or a volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad should be permitted to obtain workers' compensation insurance coverage separate and apart from that of the municipality in which they are based. If the volunteer ambulance corps or volunteer rescue or lifesaving squad does not have governmental immunity, having separate workers' compensation coverage could give it an additional layer of protection against liability.

## WHOLESALE/RETAIL MAIL ORDER HOUSE OR INTERNET SALES - DEFINITIONS

### Wholesale

For the purposes of classifying stores the term "wholesale" shall be construed to mean the selling of merchandise:

1. to retailers;
2. to manufacturers, builders or contractors;
3. to industrial, agricultural, commercial, governmental, institutional or professional users;
4. to other wholesalers; or
5. to firms acting as agents in buying merchandise for or selling merchandise to such persons or companies as those previously listed.

Wholesale store operations generally include the maintenance of warehouse inventories; delivery and the promoting of sales through utilization of an outside sales force and/or by telephone or fax. Many but not all wholesalers may also perform the physical assembling, sorting and grading of their goods; the breaking of bulk quantities and repackaging into smaller lots. A wholesaler may also have a sales counter where a walk-in customer's order may be written up and payment for merchandise made. The counter clerk may transmit the order to the warehouse or the customer may take the order to the warehouse for fulfillment.

## Mail Order House Or Internet Sales

An enterprise principally (more than 50 percent of the gross receipts) engaged in selling by mail order or by telephone by means of a catalogue mailed to customers and/or via Internet website shall be assigned to the appropriate wholesale store classification for the commodities handled, except for mail order pharmacies filling individual patient drug prescriptions which shall be assigned to Code 927. Mail, telephone order or Internet sales by a manufacturer or incidental to a retail store business shall be classified in accordance with the class or classes appropriate to the business of the employer.

## RETAIL

For purposes of classifying stores the term "Retail" shall be construed to mean the selling of displayed merchandise in store-type premises where floor and/or counter salespersons assist customers or on a self- service basis to the general public for personal or household consumption or use. Warehouse operations incident to the retail store enterprise shall be assigned to the enterprise's appropriate retail store classification.

The appropriate retail store class shall also be assigned when the insured, while technically a wholesaler, operates primarily in a retail manner. The customers will generally be commercial or professional users. "Retail manner" means such insured will have a large merchandise display area; customers may walk up and down the display aisles, inspect the merchandise being offered for sale, place their selections into either a shopping basket or shopping cart and will make payment for their selections at a customer checkout lane. The employer's single largest group(s) of employees are floor or counter salespersons assisting customers or performing customer checkout.

(The act of collecting a sales tax on merchandise sold is not a factor in defining a retail store and has no bearing upon determining the business' classification assignment.)

## WRECKING OR DEMOLITION OR BUILDING MOVING OR RAISING PROJECT

All work to completion at a wrecking or demolition or a building moving or raising site shall be assigned to one of the following classifications:

1. Code 651 – Applicable to wooden buildings or structures including those designed for residential occupancy and interior stripping/gutting.
2. Code 654 – Applicable to concrete or concrete encased buildings or structures.
3. Code 655 – Applicable to iron or steel buildings or structures.
4. Code 653 – Applicable to masonry buildings or structures.
5. Code 611 – Applicable to piers or wharfs.

The classification with the highest rating value applies where wrecking or demolition or building moving or raising involves a building or structure of more than one type of construction.

All wrecking or demolition or building moving or raising work not specifically described above shall be assigned by analogy to one of the classifications designated above. No other classification is applicable.

Secondhand material businesses at a separate location with no interchange of employees shall be assigned to the appropriate scrap metal dealer classification based on whether the dealer is principally engaged in handling ferrous or nonferrous scrap metal. Assign ferrous scrap dealers to Code 858 and assign nonferrous scrap dealers to Code 859. Assign Code 860 to secondhand materials dealers who do not have a principal line of merchandise.

# CLASSIFICATION UNDERWRITING GUIDE

The Pennsylvania Classification Underwriting Guide has been prepared for the convenience of writers of Workers Compensation Insurance in Pennsylvania. The Guide lists activities of Pennsylvania employers and the appropriate classification code number for these operations. It should be noted, however, that these designated codes may be used only in conformance with the general and specific rules of this Manual. If the operations to be insured are not described by one or more classifications, the exact operations shall be stated in the policy, followed by the code number of the Manual classification to which the operations have been assigned. In such cases, the policy shall be controlled by all the limitations and conditions included in this Manual with respect to any classification whose code number is so assigned.

Unlike a number of other jurisdictions, the Pennsylvania classification system contemplates that a single classification shall be descriptive of all work performed by one employer. Necessarily, there are permissible deviations from that basic premise. The permitted deviations are printed in this Manual either under Section 1 (which formulates general underwriting procedures) or in Section 2 (which is specific as to the use of each classification).

Therefore, in the use of this Underwriting Guide, absolute dependence may not be placed on the indicated classification if other classifications are also to be used for the same employer.

If the Underwriting Guide is used within the limits of these inherent restrictions, it is believed that it will provide a more universal comprehension of the Pennsylvania classification system and, consequently, be a valuable factor in the assignment of proper classifications.

# SECTION 3 - ENDORSEMENTS

## General Information

(Regarding standard policy, information page and endorsements)

### A. GENERAL ENDORSEMENT NOTES

1. Insurance carriers may use their own attachment clause and method of execution on each endorsement. The execution clause of endorsements issued subsequent to the policy must include at a minimum the following information: policy number, endorsement, effective date, name of the insurer and insured, and premium (if applicable). Multi-company groups must show the name or the five-digit National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. (NCCI) carrier code of the member of the group providing the insurance.

2. THE PAGES WHICH APPEAR HEREIN INCLUDE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL FROM THE NATIONAL COUNCIL ON COMPENSATION INSURANCE USED WITH ITS PERMISSION. All rights reserved.

   PENNSYLVANIA FORMS HAVE BEEN COPYRIGHTED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA COMPENSATION RATING BUREAU.

   The license extended to the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau by the NCCI for use of its copyrighted forms permits this PCRB's members to use such forms provided the form carries the legend "Copyright National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc." (with the year to be filled in in accordance with the appropriate year of copyright as found in the Forms Manual issued by the NCCI). Any of the forms included in this change may be ordered from the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc.

   The policy and endorsements have been filed on behalf of the members of the PCRB and approved by the Insurance Commissioner. Accordingly, individual filings with the Insurance Department are not required if a member carrier uses the standard forms filed by the PCRB. Any company which makes other than authorized changes in or additions to such approved PCRB forms must file the forms directly with the Insurance Department in accordance with Chapter 89b of the Pennsylvania Insurance Regulations, providing a copy of such filing to the PCRB. See Filing and Approval of Policy and Endorsements Procedure for specific instructions.

   The information page and its notes were also filed and approved as a standard form. The specific form filed was the form copyrighted by the NCCI. It will be seen that some of the notes require modifications to this form for use in Pennsylvania, while other notes give the carrier many options as to items to be included. Use of an information page which includes the Pennsylvania requirements and the exercise of any of the other specified options will be considered an approved form, subject only to filing with the PCRB. Any omission(s) of required items from an information page will require filing of such information page with the Insurance Department, with a copy of such filing to be forwarded to the PCRB.

### B. FILING AND APPROVAL OF POLICY AND ENDORSEMENTS PROCEDURE

No workers compensation or employers liability policy, information page, endorsement of related form may be used in Pennsylvania until it has been submitted to and approved by the Insurance Commissioner in accordance with Chapter 89b of the Pennsylvania Insurance Regulations. The policy form and the information page, together with the endorsements that appear in Section 3 of this Manual, have been filed by the PCRB and approved by the Insurance Commissioner on behalf of all PCRB members who have furnished the President of the PCRB with a Power of Attorney to so file on their behalf. The policy form and information page can be found in the NCCI Forms Manual identified as WC 00 00 00C and WC 00 00 01B, respectively. (Companies should contact the PCRB if they do not have access to the NCCI Forms Manual).

Effective: July 1, 2023                                                                                    Section 3
Page 443                                                                                                   Endorsements

Individual filing with the Department will not be required by any member carrier with respect to the provisions of the standard workers compensation policy and endorsements which have been filed by the PCRB and approved by the Insurance Department. The standard policy form may not be changed except that (a) special provisions may be included applicable to the members of policyholders of a mutual or participating stock insurer or a reciprocal association (b) the manual provisions for short-rate cancellation may be included. Individual filing of an information page with the Department will not be required if a carrier's page includes the NCCI standard form items together with those items indicated as requirements for Pennsylvania in the information page notes. Inclusion of additional items in accordance with the options of the information page notes will not require an individual filing, but exclusion of any basic form items or Pennsylvania requirements will require filing of such information page directly with the Department, with a copy of such filing to be sent to the PCRB.

It is important to note that the NCCI has copyrighted the policy form, the information page and all of its standard endorsement forms. In addition, the PCRB has copyrighted the Pennsylvania endorsement forms. If any of these documents are used with no modification, they must contain the appropriate copyright legend. If modifications are made to the form and authorized by the appropriate authority, the form must contain the following statement (with the appropriate year of copyright filled in as found in the Forms Manual issued by NCCI): "Includes material of the (appropriate Bureau name) Copyright 20__ used with its permission."

Following approval by the Department of the provisions of the forms filed by the PCRB, a circular letter will be issued by the PCRB notifying the members of such approval.

A new company, which is not yet a member of the PCRB, must submit its policy and information page forms directly to the Insurance Department when it applies for its license to write workers compensation insurance.

A carrier wishing to use any form that varies from the standard in any way other than that allowed in the second paragraph above must file such form directly with the Insurance Department, with a copy of the filing furnished to the PCRB.

Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance Policy

WC 00 03 11A

VOLUNTARY COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYERS LIABILITY
COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT

This endorsement adds Voluntary Compensation Insurance to the policy.

A. How This Insurance Applies

   This insurance applies to bodily injury by accident or bodily injury by disease. Bodily injury includes
   resulting death.

   1. The bodily injury must be sustained by an employee included in the group of employees described
      in the Schedule.

   2. The bodily injury must arise out of and in the course of employment necessary or incidental to work
      in a state listed in the Schedule.

   3. The bodily injury must occur in the United States of America, its territories or possessions or
      Canada, and may occur elsewhere if the employee is a United States or Canadian citizen
      temporarily away from those places.

   4. Bodily injury by accident must occur during the policy period.

   5. Bodily injury by disease must be caused or aggravated by the conditions of your employment. The
      employee's last day of last exposure to the conditions causing or aggravating such bodily injury by
      disease must occur during the policy period.

B. We Will Pay

   We will pay an amount equal to the benefits that would be required of you if you and your employees
   described in the Schedule were subject to the workers compensation law shown in the Schedule. We will
   pay those amounts to the persons who would be entitled to them under the law.

C. Exclusions

   This Insurance does not cover:

   1. any obligation imposed by a workers compensation or occupational disease law, or any similar law.

   2. bodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by you.

D. Before We Pay

   Before we pay benefits to the persons entitled to them, they must:

   1. Release you and us, in writing, of all responsibility for the injury or death.

   2. Transfer to us their right to recover from others who may be responsible for the injury or death.

   3. Cooperate with us and do everything necessary to enable us to enforce the right to recover from
      others.

   If the persons entitled to the benefits of this insurance fail to do those things, our duty to pay ends at once.

E. Recovery From Others

   If we make a recovery from others, we will keep an amount equal to our expenses of recovery and the
   benefits we paid. We will pay the balance to the persons entitled to it. If the persons entitled to the
   benefits of this insurance make a recovery from others, they must reimburse us for the benefits we paid
   them.

F. Employers Liability Insurance

   Part Two (Employers Liability Insurance) applies to bodily injury covered by this endorsement as though
   the State of employment shown in the Schedule were shown in item 3.A. of the Information Page.

## WAIVER OF OUR RIGHT TO RECOVER FROM OTHERS ENDORSEMENT

We have the right to recover our payments from anyone liable for an injury covered by this policy. We will not enforce our right against the person or organization named in the Schedule. (This agreement applies only to the extent that you perform work under a written contract that requires you to obtain this agreement from us.)

This agreement shall not operate directly or indirectly to benefit any one not named in the Schedule.

### Schedule

**Note 1:** Use this endorsement to waive the company's right of subrogation against named third parties who may be responsible for an injury.

**Note 2:** The sentence in ( ) is optional with the company. It limits the endorsement to apply only to specific jobs of the insured, and only to the extent that the insured is required to obtain this waiver.

                  PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYER ORGANIZATION (PEO) EXTENSION ENDORSEMENT

This endorsement applies only with respect to bodily injury to your leased workers in the state named in Item 2 of
the Schedule when provided by a PEO named in Item 1 of the Schedule. This endorsement does not apply with
respect to bodily injury to workers provided to you on a temporary basis.

Certain words and phrases in this endorsement are defined as follows:
        Professional Employer Organization (PEO) is an entity or group of entities who are or were formally related
        by common management or ownership that provides workers to its client(s) through a PEO arrangement for
        a fee, pursuant to an agreement, written or otherwise. Without limitation, a PEO may also be referred to as a
        labor contractor, employee leasing company, lessor, or other similarly administered arrangement.

        Client is an entity that obtains all or part of its workforce for a fee, pursuant to an agreement, written or
        otherwise, from another entity through a professional employer organization (PEO) arrangement or that
        employs the services of an entity through a PEO arrangement. Without limitation, a client may also be
        referred to as a lessee.

        Temporary worker is a worker who is furnished to an entity for a finite period of time, including but not limited
        to one or more of the following work situations:

         - Replace an absent worker who will return, such as during an authorized leave of absence, vacation, jury
           duty, or illness
         - Fill a short-term or temporary professional skill shortage
         - Staff a seasonal workload
         - Staff a special assignment or project where the worker will be terminated or assigned to another
           temporary project upon completion
         - Satisfy the requirements of the employer's overall employment program, such as a probationary period
           before new workers are granted permanent employee status

Part One (Workers Compensation Insurance) and Part Two (Employers Liability Insurance) of your policy will
apply as though the PEO is an insured. If an entry is shown in Item 3 of the Schedule, the insurance afforded by
this endorsement applies only to work you perform under the contract or at the project named in the Schedule.

Under Part One we will reimburse the PEO named in the Schedule for the benefits required by the workers
compensation law if we are not permitted to pay the benefits directly to the persons entitled to them.

The insurance afforded by this endorsement is not intended to satisfy the PEO's duty to secure its obligations
under the workers compensation law. We will not file evidence of this insurance on behalf of the labor contractor
PEO with any governmental or regulatory agency.

We will not ask any other insurer of the PEO to share with us a loss covered by this endorsement.

Premium will be charged for your leased workers while provided by the PEO. You must obtain from PEO and
furnish to us a complete payroll record of your leased workers provided by the PEO to satisfy your obligations
under Part Five (Premium), C.2. You are jointly liable with the PEO for the contributions, premiums, forfeits, or
interest attributable to the wages of the workers leased to you by the PEO.

The policy may be cancelled according to its terms or for violation of rules applicable to PEO arrangements,
provided that the PEO has been provided a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation. If the policy is cancelled,
we will send notice of such cancellation to the PEO and provide you with a notice regarding the status of your
coverage.

Part Four (Your Duties If Injury Occurs) applies to you and the PEO. The PEO will recognize our right to defend
under Parts One and Two and our right to inspect under Part Six (Conditions).

## 90-DAY REPORTING REQUIREMENT – NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP ENDORSEMENT

You must report any change in ownership to us in writing within 90 days of the date of the change. Change in ownership includes sales, purchases, other transfers, mergers, consolidations, dissolutions, formations of a new entity, and other changes provided for in the applicable experience rating plan. Experience rating is mandatory for all eligible insureds. The experience rating modification factor, if any, applicable to this policy, may change if there is a change in your ownership or in that of one or more of the entities eligible to be combined with you for experience rating purposes.

Failure to report any change in ownership, regardless of whether the change is reported within 90 days of such change, may result in revision of the experience rating modification factor used to determine your premium.

This reporting requirement applies regardless of whether an experience rating modification is currently applicable to this policy.

PENNSYLVANIA ACT 86-1986 ENDORSMENT

NONRENEWAL, NOTICE OF INCREASE OF PREMIUM, AND RETURN OF UNEARNED PREMIUM

This endorsement applies only to the insurance provided by the policy because Pennsylvania is shown in Item 3.A. of the Information Page.

The policy conditions are amended by adding the following regarding nonrenewal, notice of increase in premium, and return of unearned premium.

## Nonrenewal

1. We may elect not to renew the policy. We will mail to each named insured, by first class mail, not less than 60 days advance notice stating when the nonrenewal will take effect. Mailing that notice to you at your mailing address last known to us will be sufficient to prove notice.

2. Our notice of nonrenewal will state our specific reasons for not renewing.

3. If we have indicated our willingness to renew, we will not send you a notice of nonrenewal. However, the policy will still terminate on its expiration date if:
   a. you notify us or the agent or broker who procured this policy that you do not want the policy renewed; or
   b. you fail to pay all premiums when due; or
   c. you obtain other insurance as a replacement of the policy.

## Notice of Increase in Premium

1. We will provide you with not less than 30 days advance notice of an increase in renewal premium of this policy, if it is our intent to offer such renewal.

2. The above notification requirement will be satisfied if we have issued a renewal policy more than 30 days prior to its effective date.

3. If a policy has been written or is to be written on a retrospective rating plan basis, the notice of increase in premium provision of this endorsement does not apply.

## Return of Unearned Premium

1. If this policy is cancelled and there is unearned premium due you:
   a. If the Company cancels, the unearned premium will be returned to you within 10 business days after the effective date of cancellation.
   b. If you cancel, the unearned premium will be returned within 30 days after the effective date of cancellation.

2. Because this policy was written on the basis of an estimated premium and is subject to a premium audit, the unearned premium specified in 1a. and 1b. above, if any, shall be returned on an estimated basis. Upon our completion of computation of the exact premium, an additional return premium or charge will be made to you within 15 days of the final computation.

3. These returns of unearned premium provisions shall not apply if this policy is written on a retrospective rating plan basis.

## NOTES

1. Nonrenewal of, notice of increase in premium for, and return of unearned premium for workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance policy is governed by Act 86-1986.

2. This endorsement must be attached to a policy showing Pennsylvania in Item 3.A. of the Information Page.

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT DISCLOSURE ENDORSEMENT

This endorsement addresses the requirements of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 as amended and
extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. It serves to notify you of certain
limitations under the Act and that your insurance carrier is charging premium for losses that may occur in the
event of an Act of Terrorism.

Your policy provides coverage for workers compensation losses caused by Acts of Terrorism, including workers
compensation benefit obligations dictated by state law. Coverage for such losses is still subject to all terms,
definitions, exclusions, and conditions in your policy, and any applicable federal and/or state laws, rules, or
regulations.

Definitions

The definitions provided in this endorsement are based on and have the same meaning as the definitions in the
Act. If words or phrases not defined in this endorsement are defined in the Act, the definitions in the Act will
apply.

"Act" means the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, which took effect on November 26, 2002, and any
amendments thereto, including any amendments resulting from the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
Reauthorization Act of 2019.

"Act of Terrorism" means any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the
Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General of the United States as meeting all of the following
requirements:

a. The act is an act of terrorism.
b. The act is violent or dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure.
c. The act resulted in damage within the United States, or outside of the United States in the case of the
   premises of United States missions or certain air carriers or vessels.
d. The act has been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian
   population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States
   Government by coercion.

"Insured Loss" means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism (and, except for Pennsylvania, including an act of
war, in the case of workers compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and casualty insurance
issued by an insurer if the loss occurs in the United States or at the premises of United States missions or to
certain air carriers or vessels.

"Insurer Deductible" means, for the period beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending on December 31, 2027, an
amount equal to 20% of our direct earned premiums, during the calendar year immediately preceding calendar
year.

Limitation of Liability

The Act limits our liability to you under this policy. If aggregate Insured Losses exceed $100,000,000,000 in a
calendar year and if we have met our Insurer Deductible, we are not liable for the payment of any portion of the
amount of Insured Losses that exceeds $100,000,000,000; and for aggregate Insured Losses up to
$100,000,000,000, we will pay only a pro rata share of such Insured Losses as determined by the Secretary of the
Treasury.

# Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance Policy

WC 37 04 01

## PENNSYLVANIA AUDIT NONCOMPLIANCE CHARGE ENDORSEMENT

Part Five – Premium, Section G. (Audit) of the Workers Compensation and Employers Liability Insurance Policy is revised by adding the following:

If you do not allow us to examine and audit all of your records that relate to this policy, and/or do not provide audit information as requested, we may apply an Audit Noncompliance Charge (ANC).

The charge is determined by applying the ANC Multiplier to the ANC Basis shown in the table below:

| ANC Basis | ANC Multiplier |
|-----------|----------------|
| Estimated Annual Premium | Two times |

If you allow us to examine and audit all of your records after we have applied an ANC, we will remove the ANC and revise your premium in accordance with our manuals and Part 5 – Premium, E. (Final Premium) of this policy.

The application of the ANC is subject to the following conditions:

a) Carriers must comply with all applicable state laws and/or regulations related to audits of workers compensation insurance policies.

b) The Audit Noncompliance Charge Endorsement is optional. When used, the Audit Noncompliance Charge Endorsement and/or applicable state-specific endorsement must be attached to the policy at inception of the policy term being audited.

c) The carrier must make two attempts to obtain the audit information and/or complete the audit. At each attempt, the carrier must notify the employer regarding the specific required records and the amount of the ANC to be applied if the employer continues to refuse to comply with the audit.

d) The carrier must adequately document the audit file regarding the above attempts to obtain the required audit information.

This ANC rule applies to mail/email, telephone, computer (remote access), and physical audits, unless otherwise provided by state law.

# SECTION 4

## RETROSPECTIVE RATING PLANS – PENNSYLVANIA

Retrospective rating is an insurance pricing system which adjusts the premium for the insurance to which it applies on the basis of losses incurred during the period covered by that insurance. In Pennsylvania a carrier must file with the Pennsylvania Insurance Department such plan rules and rating values as necessary to implement retrospective rating plans for use in writing workers compensation insurance.

The Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, requires PCRB filings other than United States Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHW CA) filings to exclude all expense and profit considerations as well as loss adjustment expenses. Beginning effective December 1, 1993, the PCRB has filed and this Manual includes only selected rating values which are exclusive of expense and profit considerations for coverages other than LHW CA and which are inclusive of such provisions for LHW CA coverage.

For sake of consistency with standard language in retrospective rating plans in use in other jurisdictions selected Pennsylvania retrospective rating plan rating values are identified using terminology common to such other retrospective rating plans. The use of such terminology in this section of the Manual does not change the meaning of words or terms used elsewhere in the Manual nor are differences in precise wording used to describe specific items indicative of any substantive difference between sections. For example, the term "pure premium" used in this section and the term "loss cost" used elsewhere in this Manual are synonymous.

A carrier may file retrospective rating plans which use different and/or additional rating values from those shown in this Manual. In such cases the individual carrier values supersede application of the PCRB values. Information regarding such individual carrier retrospective rating plans must be obtained from those carriers or their authorized representatives.

GENERAL RULES

SECTION I - INSTRUCTIONS

1. The Experience Rating Plan is intended to determine whether a specific risk presents a hazard for future insurance which is better or worse than the hazard of the average risk in the classification to which the risk has been assigned.

2. The rules of this Plan shall govern the experience rating procedure to be followed in connection with workers compensation and employers' liability Insurance.

   These rules have been prepared as applicable to policies written or issued for a period not in excess of one year. When, however, policies are written for periods of more than one year, such policies shall be considered as consisting of consecutive units of twelve months, or if the period of coverage is not a multiple of twelve months, the first or last unit shall be considered as though it were a short term policy. If, however, coverage is written for a period that is more than one year but not more than one year and sixteen days, such entire period shall be considered as a unit of coverage. Each unit as defined above shall be subject separately to all of the rules and procedures specified in the Plan to the same degree as if it actually constituted a separate policy.

   In the event the policy period for a long term policy is more than one year and sixteen days, and is not made up of complete twelve-month periods, an endorsement shall be attached to the policy specifying whether the first or last unit shall be considered as though it were a short term policy.

3. This Plan and all amendments thereto, unless otherwise specifically provided, shall be applied as of the first rating effective date of the risk, as established by the PCRB, which is on or after the effective date of any change in the rules or rating values of this Plan, but shall not otherwise be available to outstanding ratings.

4. A Policy cannot be cancelled, rewritten or extended for purposes of enabling a risk to qualify for, or avoid application of this Plan.

## SECTION II – DEFINITIONS

1. Risk. The term "risk" as used in this Plan shall mean

   (a) A single legal entity.

   (b) Two or more affiliates which qualify for combination under the rules of Section III of this Plan.

2. Legal Entity. The term "legal entity" or "entity" shall mean an individual, partnership, corporation, unincorporated association or fiduciary (e.g., trustee, receiver, executor or administrator). Divisions or similar units of a legal entity do not qualify as separate entities.

3. Affiliate. The term "affiliate" shall mean entities in each of which the same entity or group of entities own a majority interest.

4. Experience. For the purpose of this Plan, experience shall mean the record established by a risk under workers compensation and employers' liability Insurance, as disclosed by the losses incurred by the insurance carrier or carriers and the payrolls or other exposures segregated according to classification of operations.

   If the classification assigned to a risk is revised or modified, for the purpose of this Plan the PCRB shall similarly reassign the classification of the experience period except that, if the revision is due to a change in operations, no part of the experience period prior to such operations change shall be affected.

   Note: For special provisions applicable to self-insurers' data see Rule 6 of Section III.

5. Appeals. Any determination or decision of the PCRB for an individual risk under the Pennsylvania Experience Rating Plan may be appealed pursuant to RULE XVI, APPEALS FROM APPLICATION OF THE RATING SYSTEM PROCEDURE, Section 1 of this Manual.

6. Rating Effective Date (RED) is the earliest date that a specific experience modification is applied to a policy.

## SECTION III – GENERAL PROVISIONS

1. Eligibility Requirements. A risk shall qualify for rating under this Plan if the premium developed by the
audited payrolls or other exposures of the experience period, extended at current PCRB Loss Costs, is
$10,000 or more.

   (a) Eligibility requirements will be determined without consideration of Maritime Liability, Liability under the
       Federal Employers' Liability Act, Excess Limits and Additional Medical Coverage, the nonrateable
       element for Explosives Manufacturing, and Atomic Energy Projects.

   (b) Risks shall be disqualified by a lapse of insurance of two years or more until they again qualify for
       experience rating following the lapse.

   (c) The RED may differ from a risk's policy effective date for reasons including, but not limited to:

      • Short–term policies
      • Cancellations
      • Gaps in Coverage
      • Changes in ownership or combinability status
      • Multiple policy effective dates
      • A policy that is longer than one year and 16 days
      • Late receipt of current policy information by the PCRB

   To determine a risk's RED, the PCRB will review the most recent full–term policies and unit statistical data.
   For purposes of this rule, a full–term policy is written for 12 months and is not cancelled prior to its expiration
   date.

   The application of Rules 2 and 3 of this section is subject to the provisions of Section V "Tabulation of
   Experience" of this
   Plan.

2. Experience Period. The experience period, except as otherwise provided in Rules 3 and 4 of this Section,
shall be not more than three (3) years, commencing four (4) years prior and terminating one (1) year prior to
the date for which an experience modification is to be established, but in no event shall be less than the one
policy year (twelve months) commencing two (2) years prior and terminating one (1) year prior to the date for
which an experience modification is to be established. Completed policy periods only shall be used and all
such periods wholly within the experience period shall be used.

3. Experience Period Extension.

   If for any reason a part of the earliest policy period falls outside of the normal three (3) year maximum period,
   such earliest policy period shall be retained in full provided the entire experience period does not then exceed
   three and three-quarters (3¾) years and shall be rejected in full if its retention serves to increase the
   experience period beyond three and three-quarters (3¾) years.

4. Multiple Policy Experience. If the experience used in rating a risk involves two or more policies varying in
expiration date, the experience period shall be determined for each entity separately in accordance with the
foregoing rules, except that the experience for each non-controlling entity shall close with the completed
policy period beginning more than one year and terminating not less than six months prior to the date for
which an experience modification is to be established.

Section 5
EXPERIENCE RATING PLAN

5. Experience to be Used. The experience of the risk (except as otherwise provided in Rule 5 of section of IV and Rule 1 of Section V of this Plan) incurred within the experience period on all its operations, whether such operations are normal to the business or otherwise, shall be reported and used in determining the experience modification. The PCRB will verify any or all the data from which the experience modification is to be determined.

6. Self-Insurers' Data. The experience of self-insurers may be accepted by the PCRB provided the experience on self- insured operations is submitted on the approved form, giving the required information with respect to payrolls and losses. Such statement shall be secured, verified and submitted by an interested carrier.

Self-insured experience shall not be used in rating a risk unless the operations that produced such experience are to be insured under a Standard Workers Compensation and Employers' Liability Policy.

7. Administration of Property (Fiduciary and Non-Fiduciary). Ownership interest shall be deemed to be vested in a fiduciary when a fiduciary is involved. However, "Fiduciary" shall not include a debtor in possession or a trustee under a revocable trust or a franchisor. Ownership interest held by an entity in a fiduciary capacity and ownership interest held by the same entity in a non-fiduciary capacity shall be deemed to be ownership by the same entity.

COMBINATIONS OR CHANGED OF STATUS

8. Combination of Entities.

(a) Affiliates shall be combined for rating purposes if:

   (i) The affiliates involved constitute the component parts of an enterprise performing a continuous and/or integrated process or operation, or

   (ii) There is interchange of employment (other than office and salesmen) between two or more of the affiliates involved in the combination.

   Separate policies may not be issued to affiliates, which are required to be combined under this rule.

(b) Affiliates which are not required to be combined under Rule 8(a) may be combined upon the mutual agreement of the risk and the carrier(s) involved. If such combination is agreed to, insurance may be provided either by a single policy insuring all affiliates, or by separate policies for each affiliate issued by one or more insurance carriers. In the latter case, the experience modification established for the entire risk shall apply on each policy to each affiliate. If all affiliates are not combined, then each affiliate not otherwise subject to Rule 8(a) shall be insured under a separate policy and rated on its own experience, providing it meets the qualifications for experience rating as specified in Rule 1 of this Section.

(c) When one or more mandatory combinations of affiliates under Rule 8(a) exist, insurance for each such combination may be provided by a single policy. Each mandatory combination and any other affiliates which are not required to be a part of any mandatory combination pursuant to Rule 8(a) may be separately rated and separately insured. Exception: If any one or more affiliates not required to be combined under Rule 8(a) or mandatory combinations voluntarily choose to be insured under a single policy, then all affiliates shall be insured under a single policy and the experience modification established for the entire risk shall apply to each affiliate.

Example:

Five legal entities are commonly owned. Company A and Company B have an interchange of employees. Company C and Company D have a continuity of operations. Company E is unrelated except through ownership.

Effective: July 1, 2023                                                                                    Section 5
Page 514                                                                                                   EXPERIENCE RATING PLAN

By Rule 8(a), Company A and Company B must be combined for rating and must be covered by a single policy.
Similarly, by Rule 8(a), Company C and Company D must be combined for rating and must be covered by a single
policy. Company E may be separately rated and covered by a separate policy.

| Company    | Rating    | Policy    |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Company A  | Combined  | Combined  |
| Company B  | A & B     | Policy 1  |
| Company C  | Combined  | Combined  |
| Company D  | C & D     | Policy 2  |
| Company E  | Separate  | Policy 3  |

If any combination of these separate policy coverages is elected, then all commonly owned entities must be
combined for rating and must be covered by a single policy. Thus, if Companies A and B desire to be combined
with Company E, they must also combine with Companies C and D, and all must be covered by a single policy.

(d)    If an entity owns a majority interest in another entity which, in turn, owns the majority interest in
       another entity, all entities so related shall be considered as being under the same ownership for the
       purposes of this rule, regardless of the number of entities in succession.

(e)    Separate legal entities organized for religious purposes within the same religious denomination shall
       not be combined for rating purposes; provided, however, that combination may be made as respects
       all such entities in each of which the same central authority appoints or controls the appointment of
       the board of trustees or similar body and exercises direct, complete and active control over the
       finances, properties, operations and activities.

In the term "majority interest," as used in this rule, "majority" shall mean more than 50%.

If an entity other than a partnership

i.    has issued voting stock, majority interest shall mean a majority of the issued voting stock;

ii.   has not issued voting stock, majority interest shall mean a majority of the members;

iii.  has not issued voting stock and has no members, majority interest shall mean a majority of the
     board of directors or comparable governing body.

If an entity is a partnership, majority interest shall be determined in accordance with the
participation of each general partner in the profits of the partnership.

Note:   If a combination of entities is required or has been elected, and if two or more
        different combinations are possible in accordance with the provisions of this rule,
        the combination involving the greatest number of entities shall be made. The
        experience of any entity used in such a combination shall not otherwise be used in
        combination with any other entity.

        The experience to be used in a rating combination shall be subject to the
        provisions of the rule "Change of Ownership" of this Section.

Effective: July 1, 2023                                                                                    Section 5
Page 515                                                                                                   EXPERIENCE RATING PLAN

(f)     Affiliates combined for rating voluntarily (i.e., not a mandatory combination), which wish to change
        their rating option and have each affiliate separately rated based on its individual experience, may
        petition the PCRB to do so. Upon PCRB approval, separate policies must be issued for each affiliate.
        Unless the PCRB is provided with the segregated experience needed to produce separate ratings for
        each affiliate in an acceptable format, each affiliate will continue to be rated using combined
        experience for any policy period(s) for which segregated experience is not available and its own
        separately reported experience for policy period(s) subsequent to the separation.

9.      Ownership Changes.

(a)   For purposes of this Plan, a change in ownership includes any of the following:

        (i)   sale, transfer or conveyance of all or a portion of an entity's ownership interest

        (ii)  sale, transfer or conveyance of an entity's physical assets to a purchasing entity which takes
             over the operation of the selling entity and wherein the selling entity

             (a)    becomes entirely inactive with no employees or

             (b)    retains a few employees for the purpose of closing out its affairs prior to dissolution as a
                    legal entity or

             (c)    retains a few clerical employees for the purpose of carrying on operations in
                    connection with investment of its financial assets

        (iii)  merger or consolidation of two or more entities

        (iv)   formation of a new entity subsequent to the dissolution or non-operative capacity of an entity

        (v)    voluntary or court mandated establishment of a trustee or receiver, excluding a debtor in
               possession, a trustee under a revocable trust or franchisor

(b)     Reporting Requirement. When an ownership change occurs, the 90 Day Reporting
        Requirement - Notification of Change in Ownership Endorsement (WC 00 04 14 A) requires any
        change in ownership and/or combinability status be reported in writing by the employer to its carrier
        within ninety (90) days of the date of the change. This can be accomplished by submitting a
        completed Confidential Request for Information Form (ERM-14 form) or by providing the information
        in narrative form on the letterhead of the insured, signed by an officer of the entity.

        Failure to report changed in ownership in line with Endorsement WC 00 04 14 A may be considered
        modification evasion. See Section 111, 9-h.

(c)     Continuation of Experience. Unless excluded under paragraph (d), the experience for any entity
        undergoing a change in ownership shall be transferred to the experience of the acquiring, surviving
        or new entity. The date of revision will be the later of the following two dates: 1) the effective date of
        the policy in effect at the time the PCRB receives a completed ERM-14 form outlining the ownership
        change or 2) the date on which the change in ownership occurred.

        (i)   Partial Sale: If an entity disposes of a part of its assets or operations but otherwise continues
              to operate its business, all experience incurred prior to the sale shall be used in future ratings
              of the entity.

        NOTE: Future experience ratings of a risk shall retain all experience for any part of its operations
        which may have been discontinued or self-insured.

Page 516                                                                                                   EXPERIENCE RATING PLAN

(d) Exclusion of Experience. The experience of any entity undergoing a change in ownership shall be
    retained and used in future experience ratings unless one or both of the following requirements (i)
    and (ii) are met at the same time of the ownership change:

    (i)  A change in majority interest occurs and the change in majority interest is accompanied by a
         complete change in operation and function sufficient to result in a change of governing
         classification and the change in majority interest is accompanied by a change in the process
         and hazard of the operation

    (ii) A change in majority interest occurs and the change in majority interest is accompanied by a
         change in employees such that all or a substantial portion of the employees of the new
         ownership are not retained from the prior ownership.

(e) If the experience of an entity undergoing a change in ownership is to be excluded from future
    experience ratings for the entity, the experience modification no longer applies as of the date of the
    ownership change unless the entity is acquired by another entity which has an existing experience
    modification. In that case, the modification of the acquiring entity shall apply.

(f) Multiple Entities. When two entities under substantially the same ownership have been insured
    under a single policy, and the ownership of one or both of them is changed so that there is no
    longer any connection between them, the procedure shall be as follows:

    (i)  If the experience of the entities has been combined for rating purposes during the entire
         experience period, the experience incurred prior to the change shall not be used for future
         ratings, unless

         (a) the insurance carrier or carriers request that new modifications be established, and

         (b) the PCRB is furnished with the experience required for the calculation of such
             modifications submitted in an acceptable format.

    (ii) If the experience of the entities has been combined for less than two years at the time of the
         change, so that the experience for each entity is available during the period they were
         separately insured, the experience for each entity shall be used for the purpose of calculating
         new experience modifications.

         When three or more entities under substantially the same ownership have been insured under
         a single policy, and the ownership of one of the entities has been changed so that there is no
         longer any connection between it and the remaining entities, the existing experience
         modification shall continue to apply to the entities whose ownership has not changed. The
         entity whose ownership has changed shall not be subject to experience modification unless it
         has been purchased by an entity which has an applicable experience modification.

         When three or more entities under substantially the same ownership have been insured under
         a single policy and the ownership of two or more of the entities has been changed so that
         common ownership no longer is present, the experience incurred prior to the date of the
         change shall not be used for future ratings, unless

         (i)  the insurance carrier or carriers request that new modifications be established, and

         (ii) the PCRB is furnished with the experience required for the calculation of such
              modifications submitted in an acceptable format.

(g) Employee Leasing. If (1) an entity terminates its employment relationship with all, or substantially all, its employees, (2) all or substantially all such employees are thereafter employed by another entity which leases such employees to the original employer, and (3) workers compensation insurance for the leased employees is provided under a Master Policy issued to the second entity, the experience incurred prior to the termination of the original employment relationship shall be used in future ratings of the second entity. See Section 1, Rule XVII – Professional Employer Organizations, Professional Employer Agreements and Professional Employer Services for additional information.

(h) Evasion Of Experience Rating Modification.

(i) Actions. Employers, or their representatives, at times take actions for the purpose of avoiding an experience rating modification. They may also take actions for otherwise legitimate business reasons that nonetheless result in the improper application of an experience rating modification. Regardless of intent, any action resulting in the miscalculation, misapplication or omission of an experience rating modification determined in accordance with this Plan is prohibited. These actions can include, but are not limited to:

(a) Failure to report changes in accordance with Endorsement WC 00 04 14
(b) A change in ownership
(c) change in combinability status
(d) Creation of a new entity
(e) Misrepresentation on audits or failure to cooperate with an audit

(ii) PCRB Response. In such circumstances the PCRB may obtain information that indicates evasion or improper calculation, application or omission of experience rating modifications due to actions included, but not limited to, those listed above. The PCRB will act to ensure the proper calculation and application of experience rating modifications impacted by these actions. This may include, but is not limited to the:

(a) Combination of experience that would otherwise not be combinable
(b) Separation of experience that would otherwise be combinable
(c) Exclusion of experience that would otherwise be included
(d) Continuation of experience that would otherwise be withdrawn
(e) Issuance of experience rating modifications that were not originally issued
(f) Revision and/or retraction of experience rating modifications

10. Joint Ventures. When two or more risks associate for the purpose of undertaking one or more projects as a joint venture, the premium for the operation involved shall not be subject to experience modification until such time as the joint venture qualifies for experience rating in accordance with the provisions of Rule 1 of this Section, subject, however, to the following conditions:

(1) The contracts shall be awarded in the name of the associated risks as a joint venture.

(2) The joint ventures shall share responsibility for, and participate in the control, direction and supervision of all work undertaken.

(3) The joint ventures shall maintain a common bank account, payroll and business records.

(4) When the joint venture becomes subject to experience rating, all applicable experience modifications shall be based exclusively on the experience of the joint venture. The experience developed under a joint venture shall be excluded from the future rating of the individual ventures.

## SECTION IV
### APPLICATION OF EXPERIENCE MODIFICATION

1. Experience Modification. An experience modification for a qualified risk shall be determined annually
(except as provided in Rules 3 and 4 of this Section) and shall be effective as of the RED of the risk. No more
than one experience modification shall apply to a risk at the same time. Subject to the exceptions noted
below, the experience modification shall be applied to the premium developed by the use of carrier rates in
force on the effective date of the policy.

EXCEPTIONS:

Premiums Not Subject to Experience Rating:

The following are not subject to experience rating:

i. Expense Constants.
ii. The policy minimum premium.
iii. Premium under the National Defense Projects Rating Plan.
iv. Premium under Rule 1 of the Atomic Energy Procedure.
v. The surcharge premium under Rule 2 of the Atomic Energy Procedure.
vi. Premium developed under Code 9740 – Terrorism
vii. Premium developed under Code 9741 – Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism)
viii. Premium developed under Code 1212 – Payments to Paid Furloughed Employees Due to Covid–19

Exception viii is applicable to new, renewal and in-force policies effective March 1, 2020, through
June 30, 2023.

Exception viii does not apply to new or renewal policies with effective dates on or after July 1, 2023.

2. Period and Operations Affected. The experience modification shall be effective for a period of twelve
months (except as provided in Rules 3 and 4 of this Section) and shall apply to all the operations of the risk,
regardless of whether the current or any new operations are assigned to the same classifications as were
used in establishing such modification.

3. Single Policy Risk. If a risk is covered by a single policy, the following procedure shall apply:

(a) The experience modification effective as of the RED shall apply for the full term of the policy which
becomes effective on such date and also for the full term of any policy which becomes effective within
three months after such date.

(b) If a policy is written for a period of one year, but is extended for a period of not more than 16 days, the
experience modification in effect as of the original termination date shall remain in effect until the
termination date of the extended policy. The experience modification which would have become
effective as of the RED shall apply for a period of one year from the effective date of the new policy.

(c) If a policy becomes effective on a date more than three months after the RED:

i. the outstanding experience modification shall apply to the new policy for the period corresponding
to the unexpired term of the rating.

ii. a new experience modification then shall apply for the unexpired term of the outstanding policy.

iii. thereafter, a new modification shall apply annually as of a new RED. The new RED shall be the
    date twelve months after the effective date of the new policy.

4. Multiple Policy Risk. If a risk is covered by several policies (as provided in Rule 8 of Section III of this Plan)
   which differ as to inception dates, the following procedure shall apply:

   A single experience modification shall be computed to be effective for a period of twelve months beginning on
   the RED to be established by the PCRB. The PCRB may, however, authorize the application of an existing
   experience modification for a period not to exceed fifteen months or a new experience modification for a
   period greater than three months and less than twelve months for the purpose of establishing a new RED.
   Any policy effective prior to the new RED established by the PCRB shall be cancelled as of such date and
   rewritten for a period of twelve months. Any policy effective subsequent to the new RED established by the
   PCRB shall be written to expire concurrently with the next ensuing RED or shall be cancelled as of that date.

   Any policies subject to this rule which are extended beyond the new period of twelve months shall be subject
   to the provisions of Rules 3(b) and 3(c) of this Section.

5. Contingent Experience Modifications

   (a) A contingent experience modification is one that is missing some data but still meets the minimum data
       requirement displayed in the Minimum Data Requirements Table.

   (b) Contingent experience modifications are subject to the premium eligibility requirements and must attain
       the minimum data requirements displayed in the Minimum Data Requirements Table.

   (c) Minimum Data Requirements:
       The following table provides the possible minimum data requirements for all experience periods under
       the PCRB Experience Rating Plan. Refer to Rule 3, Section III of this Plan for additional information
       regarding the experience period.

## SECTION V
## TABULATION OF EXPERIENCE

1. Experience Used for Rating. The experience used for rating purposes shall be the individual risk experience valued at least three months prior to the rating date and reported in accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Statistical Plan. It shall include Voluntary Compensation insurance, but shall exclude Maritime Employments and Employments under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.

2. Rating Forms. To determine the experience modification, the prescribed experience shall be tabulated by the PCRB on an approved rating form.

3. Payrolls. The audited payrolls or other exposures for each classification for the experience period shall be tabulated by policy years.

4. Losses. Incurred losses shall be tabulated by policy years in the manner indicated below.

   (a) Losses as reported (indemnity, medical and total) shall be shown for each policy year. Losses incurred shall be on a gross basis before the application of the deductible, when such coverage is provided.

   (b) Losses which are subject to average or limiting values, as provided in Rule 5 of this Section, shall be listed individually, showing the total cost of each case as reported and as used for rating purposes. Multiple injury accidents shall be identified in the appropriate column of the rating form.

   Exception: All claims reported with Catastrophe Code No. 48 shall be excluded from experience rating calculations. Refer to Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Statistical Plan Manual, Section 2, C. 11. for definition of losses included under Catastrophe Code No. 48.

   Exception: All claims reported with Catastrophe Code No. 12 with an accident date of December 1, 2019, through June 30, 2023, shall be excluded from experience rating calculations. Refer to Pennsylvania Workers Compensation Statistical Plan Manual, Section 2, C. 11 for the definition of losses included under Catastrophe Code No. 12.

5. Limitation on Total Losses Employed in a Rating. To prevent unreasonable increases in rate for accidents whose occurrence or severity is a matter of chance, a scale of values has been determined and is to be used in place of the actual cost of such accidents when the actual cost exceeds the limiting value. No single accident, whether to one or more persons, shall be used for rating purposes at a value greater than that shown in Table B, column (3).

   Exceptions: Multiple injury accidents in the Explosives and Ammunitions Mfg. Classifications (Exception: Code 4777, Explosives Distribution), shall be used for rating purposes at not more than twice the value of Table B, column (3) if two persons are injured, at not more than three times if three persons are injured and at not more than four times if four or more persons are injured.

6. Moral Responsibility. No loss shall be excluded from the experience of a risk on the ground that the employer was not morally responsible for the accident that caused such loss.

7. Revision of Losses. It shall not be permissible to revise values because of department or judicial decision or because of developments in the nature of injury between two valuation dates except in cases:

   (a) Revision of Losses. It shall not be permissible to revise values because of department or judicial decision or because of developments in the nature of injury between two valuation dates except in cases:

Page 521                                                                                                    EXPERIENCE RATING PLAN

(b) where a claim is declared non-compensable (see note below), or

(c) where the claimant or carrier has recovered in an action against a third party, or

(d) where a claim should have been reported with Catastrophe Code No. 48, or

(e) where a claim or a portion of a claim is ruled or officially declared fraudulent, or

(f) where a claim should have been reported with Catastrophe Code No. 12.

In the above circumstances, revised statistical report(s) are required to be submitted in accordance with the
approved Statistical Plan. When a change to a claim value due to the above circumstances is known to the insurer
with certainty within 48 months of the expiration of an experience rating which included loss values for that claim,
such revised statistical report(s) shall be used to adjust that experience rating. Such adjustments to experience
ratings shall be made regardless of when the correction report(s) reflecting the cited event(s) is/are submitted to or
received by the PCRB.

Note: For purposes of this rule, the term "non-compensable" refers to:

i. an official ruling specifically holding that a claimant is not entitled to benefits under the
provisions of the
Pennsylvania Workers Compensation or Occupational Disease Act.

ii. a case where no claim was filed during the period of limitation provided by the Pennsylvania
Workers Compensation or Occupational Disease Act for the filing of such claim and the
carrier therefore closes the case.

iii. a case where the carrier contends, prior to the valuation date, that a claimant is not entitled to
benefits under the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation or Occupational Disease Act and
the claim is officially closed because of the claimant's failure to prosecute his claim.

8. Third Party Cases.

(a) Pending Cases. When a negligence claim or suit has been instituted by a claimant against a third
party, the procedure shall be as follows:

If the claim or suit against the third party has not been settled or finally adjudicated, the incurred
loss shall be included in the rating, since failure to recover against a third party is no bar to
compensation and the insurance carrier may eventually be obliged to indemnify the claimant in
whole or in part for the loss sustained.

(b) Settled Cases. In cases where the carrier has received reimbursement under subrogation rights, or
where the injured employee or his dependents have recovered from a third party, only the net losses
shall be used in the rating and will not exceed the maximum accident limitation values in Table B,
column (3).

## SECTION VI
## RATING PROCEDURE

1. Actual Losses. Actual Losses (A), as tabulated in accordance with the provisions of Rules 4 and 5 of
   Section V, shall be used in the rating.

2. Expected Losses. Expected Losses (E) shall be determined from the application of the appropriate
   Expected Loss Factor, shown in Table A, to the payrolls or other exposures for each classification for the
   experience period.

3. Credibility. The Credibility (C) of the experience of the risk shall correspond to Expected Losses (E), as
   shown in Table B.

4. Maximum Value Charge. A limitation charge (L) reflecting the loss dollars eliminated by the Maximum Value
   placed on One Accident, shall be included in calculating the modification. The Charge times Credibility, or L x
   C, shall be determined by entering Table B at the level of Expected Losses for the experience period.

5. Experience Modification. The Experience Modification (M) shall be determined from the formula:

   AC + ELC + E(1.000 – C)
   ----------------------- = Indicated Modification, Final Modification Capped to =/- 25%
              E
   of Prior Modification, except that where the indicated Modification is less than unity (1.000) and the
   Capped Modification is greater than unity (1.000), then the Final Modification shall be set equal to unity
   (1.000)

   The experience modification shall be rounded to three decimal places

## SECTION VII
## SCHEDULE RATING PLAN

1. The loss and/or expense components or an insured risk's premium may, at the option of the underwriting carrier, be adjusted in accordance with provisions of this plan to reflect defined characteristics of the risk which, in the sole judgment of the underwriting carrier, are not adequately reflected in prior experience of the insured risk.

2. At the option of the underwriting carrier, this plan may be applied to any risk regardless of premium size.

3. All statistical reporting requirements of the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau and the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, including provisions of the Pennsylvania Statistical Plan Manual, Annual Calls for Financial Data Experience and Pennsylvania Special Schedule W, are applicable to business written in accordance with this plan and must be complied with by carriers using this plan.

4. Schedule rating credits or debits must be applied as a percentage factor to premium computed after experience modification (if the insured is eligible for experience rating) and before carrier premium discounts and expense constants if applicable.

5. Schedule rating adjustments for any given risk shall be based on information contained in the carrier's files and records when the credit or debit is determined, and such supporting information must be retained in the carrier's files and records for such risk throughout the period of time in which the policy is subject to audit under provisions of the policy.

6. Acceptance of a policy by an insured shall constitute agreement with the amount of schedule rating credit or debit, if applicable, or with the absence of any such credit or debit, if not applicable. Upon request of the insured, a carrier shall make available documentation supporting the derivation of any proposed schedule rating credit or debit.

7. Upon request of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department or the Pennsylvania Compensation Rating Bureau, a carrier shall make available documentation supporting the derivation of a credit or debit for any specified risk or risks.

8. No schedule rating credit or debit may be effective prior to the underwriting insurer's receipt of information for a risk supporting the schedule rating credit or debit in question. No schedule rating credit or debit may be changed mid-term without the mutual agreement of the insured risk and the underwriting carrier.

9. The following risk characteristics are eligible under this plan for assignment of credits or debits subject to the maximum ranges set forth below:

| Risk Characteristic | Allowable Range of Credits or Debits |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Features of Workplace Maintenance or Operation | -10% to +10% |
| Risk Elements Not Addressed in Classification Plan | -10% to +10% |
| Availability of Medical Facilities in or Near Workplace | -5% to +5% |
| Safety Equipment/Devices Present in/Missing From Workplace | -5% to +5% |
| Extraordinary Safety Programs Applicable to Workplace | -5% to +5% |
| Qualifications of Employees | -10% to +10% |

# GENERAL RULES

## SECTION I – INSTRUCTIONS

1. The Merit Rating Plan is intended to grant premium discounts or assess premium surcharges to employers which do not qualify under the uniform Experience Rating Plan. Premium discounts or surcharges under this Plan shall be based on the number of compensable employee lost-time injuries incurred by each risk during the most recent two year period for which statistics are available. Claims to be counted under this Plan are defined in Section V - Tabulation of Experience.

2. The rules of this Plan shall govern the merit rating procedure to be followed in connection with workers compensation and employers' liability insurance. These rules have been prepared as applicable to policies written or issued for a period not in excess of one year. When, however, policies are written for periods of more than one year, such policies shall be considered as consisting of consecutive units of twelve months, or, if the period of coverage is not a multiple of twelve months, the first or last unit shall be considered as though it were a short term policy. If, however, coverage is written for a period that is more than one year but not more than one year and sixteen days, such entire period shall be considered as a unit of coverage. Each unit as defined above shall be subject separately to all of the rules and procedures specified in the Plan to the same degree as if it actually constituted a separate policy.

   In the event the policy period for a long-term policy is more than one year and sixteen days and is not made up of complete 12-month periods, an endorsement shall be attached to the policy specifying whether the first or last unit shall be considered as though it were a short term policy.

3. This Plan and all amendments thereto, unless otherwise specifically provided, shall be applied as of the first RED of the risk, as established by the PCRB, which is on or after the effective date of any change in the rules or rating values of this Plan but shall not otherwise be available to outstanding ratings.

4. It shall not be permissible by cancellation or rewriting or by the extension of the policy term to alter an existing policy for the purpose of enabling the risk to qualify for or avoid application of this Plan.

5. Appeals. Any determination or decision of the PCRB for an individual risk under the Pennsylvania Merit Rating Plan may be appealed pursuant to Rule XVI, APPEALS FROM APPLICATION OF THE RATING SYSTEM PROCEDURE, Section 1 of this Manual.

   a) A single legal entity.

   b) Two or more affiliates which qualify for combination under the rules of Section III of this Plan.

2. Legal Entity. The term "legal entity" or "entity" shall mean an individual, partnership, corporation, unincorporated association or fiduciary (e.g., trustee, receiver, executor or administrator). Divisions or similar units of a legal entity do not qualify as separate entities.

If the classification assigned to a risk is revised or modified, for the purpose of this Plan the PCRB shall similarly reassign the classification of the experience period except that, if the revision is due to a change in operations, no part of the experience period prior to such operations change shall be affected.

5. Compensable Employee Lost-Time Injury. The term "compensable employee lost-time injury" for purposes of this Plan shall mean any claim having either an indemnity benefit payment or a case reserve for future indemnity benefit payments.

   All claims reported with Catastrophe Code No. 48 shall be excluded from merit rating calculations.

   All claims reported with Catastrophe Code No.12 shall be excluded from merit rating calculations.

6. Rating Effective Date (RED) is the earliest date that a specific merit rating adjustment is applied.

7. Merit Rating Plan Discount. The term "Merit Rating Plan discount" for purposes of this Plan shall mean a reduction in the subject premium developed by the use of the carrier rates in force on the RED applicable to the policy to which the Merit Rating Plan is applied.

8. Merit Rating Plan Surcharge. The term "Merit Rating Plan surcharge" for purposes of this Plan shall mean an increase in the subject premium developed by the use of the carrier rates in force on the RED applicable to the policy to which the Merit Rating Plan is applied.

9. Merit Rating Plan Adjustment. The term "Merit Rating Plan adjustment" for purposes of this Plan shall mean either a Merit Rating Plan discount or a Merit Rating Plan surcharge.

10. Subject Premium. The term "subject premium" for purposes of this Plan shall mean the premium developed by the use of carrier rates in force on the RED of the policy to which the Merit Rating Plan is applied, exclusive of exceptions listed in Section IV, Paragraph 1.

## SECTION III – GENERAL PROVISIONS

1. Eligibility Requirements. A risk shall qualify for application of the Merit Rating Plan if BOTH of the following conditions are met:

   a) The risk does not qualify for experience rating, and

   b) The risk has exposure greater than zero during each year of the Merit Rating Plan experience period as defined herein.

      i) Eligibility requirements will be determined without consideration of maritime liability, liability under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, excess limits and additional medical coverage, the nonrateable element for explosives manufacturing, and atomic energy projects.

      ii) Risks shall be disqualified by a lapse of insurance of two years or more until they again qualify for merit rating following the lapse.

   The application of Rule 2 of this section is subject to the provisions of Section V "Tabulation of Experience" of this Plan.

2. Merit Rating Plan Experience Period. The experience period for purposes of the Merit Rating Plan shall be not more than two (2) years, commencing three (3) years prior and terminating one (1) year prior to the date for which a Merit Rating Plan adjustment is to be established but in no event shall be less than one policy year (12 months) commencing two (2) years prior and terminating one (1) year prior to the date for which merit rating is to be established. Completed policy periods only shall be used, and all such periods wholly within the experience period shall be used.

3. Multiple Policy Experience. If the experience used in rating a risk involves two or more policies varying in expiration date, the experience period shall be determined for each entity separately in accordance with the foregoing rules, except that the experience for each non-controlling entity shall close with the completed policy period beginning more than one year and terminating not less than six months prior to the date for which a Merit Rating Plan adjustment is to be established.

4. Experience to be Used. The entire experience of the risk (except as otherwise provided in Rule I of Section V of this Plan) incurred within the experience period on all its operations, whether such operations are normal to the business or otherwise, shall be reported and used in determining the Merit Rating Plan adjustment. The PCRB may, at its discretion, verify any or all the data from which the Merit Rating Plan adjustment is to be determined.

   Experience developed on work let to and performed by an uninsured contractor shall be considered as the experience of the primary contractor or principal whose insurance carrier is liable for the payment of compensation under any provision of the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation and Occupational Disease Acts, as respects such work.

5. Self-Insurers' Data. The experience of self-insurers may be accepted by the PCRB provided the experience on self-insured operations is submitted on the approved form, giving the required information with respect to payrolls and losses. Such statement shall be secured, verified and submitted by an interested carrier.

   Self-insured experience shall not be used in applying the Merit Rating Plan to a risk unless the operations that produced such experience are to be insured under a Standard Workers Compensation and Employers' Liability Policy.

Section 6
MERIT RATING PLAN

6. Administration of Property (Fiduciary and Non-Fiduciary). Ownership interest shall be deemed to be vested in a fiduciary when a fiduciary is involved. However, "Fiduciary" shall not include a debtor in possession or a trustee under a revocable trust or a franchisor. Ownership interest held by an entity in a fiduciary capacity and ownership interest held by the same entity in a non-fiduciary capacity shall be deemed to be ownership by the same entity.

COMBINATIONS OR CHANGES OF STATUS

7. Combination of Entities

   a) Affiliates shall be combined for merit rating purposes if:

      i) The affiliates involved constitute the component parts of an enterprise performing a continuous and/or integrated process or operation, or

      ii) There is interchange of employment (other than office and salesmen) between two or more of the affiliates.

   Separate policies may not be issued to affiliates which are required to be combined under this rule.

   b) Affiliates which are not required to be combined under Rule 7 (a) may be combined upon the mutual agreement of the risk and the carrier(s) involved. If such combination is agreed to, insurance may be provided either by a single policy insuring all affiliates or by separate policies for each affiliate issued by one or more insurance carriers. In the latter case the Merit Rating Plan adjustment established for the entire risk shall apply on each policy to each affiliate. If all affiliates are not combined, then each affiliate not otherwise subject to Rule 7 (a) shall be insured under a separate policy and merit-rated based on its own experience, providing it meets the qualification for merit rating as specified in Rule 1 of this section.

   c) When one or more mandatory combinations of affiliates under Rule 7. (a) exist, insurance for each such combination may be provided by a single policy. Each mandatory combination and any other affiliates which are not required to be a part of any mandatory combination pursuant to Rule 7. (a) may be separately merit-rated and separately insured. Exception: If any one or more affiliates not required to be combined under Rule 7. (a) or mandatory combinations voluntarily choose to be insured under a single policy, then all affiliates shall be insured under a single policy and the Merit Rating Plan adjustment established for the entire risk shall apply to each affiliate.

Example

Five legal entities are commonly owned. Company A and Company B have an interchange of employees. Company C and Company D have a continuity of operations. Company E is unrelated except through ownership.

By Rule 7. (a) Company A and Company B must be combined for merit rating and must be covered by a single policy. Similarly, by Rule 7. (a) Company C and Company D must be combined for merit rating and must be covered by a single policy. Company E may be separately merit-rated and covered by a separate policy.

| Company   | Merit Rating | Policy    |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Company A | Combined     | Combined  |
| Company B | A & B        | Policy 1  |
| Company C | Combined     | Combined  |
| Company D | C & D        | Policy 2  |
| Company E | Separate     | Policy 3  |

If any combination of these separate policy coverages is elected, then all commonly-owned entities must be combined for merit rating and must be covered by a single policy. Thus, if Companies A and B desire to be combined with Company E, they must also combine with Companies C and D, and all must be covered by a single policy.

d) If an entity owns a majority interest in another entity which, in turn, owns the majority interest in another entity, all entities so related shall be considered as being under the same ownership for the purposes of this rule, regardless of the number of entities in succession.

e) Separate legal entities organized for religious purposes within the same religious denomination shall not be combined for merit rating purposes, provided, however, that combination may be made as respects all such entities in each of which the same central authority appoints or controls the appointment of the board of trustees or similar body and exercises direct, complete and active control over the finances, properties, operations and activities.

In the term "majority interest," as used in this rule, "majority" shall mean more than 50 percent.

If an entity other than a partnership

i) has issued voting stock, majority interest shall mean a majority of the issued voting stock.

ii) has not issued voting stock, majority interest shall mean a majority of the members.

iii) has not issued voting stock and has no members, majority interest shall mean a majority of the board of directors or comparable governing body.

If an entity is a partnership, majority interest shall be determined in accordance with the participation of each general partner in the profits of the partnership.

Note: If a combination of entities is required or has been elected and if two or more different combinations are possible in accordance with the provisions of this rule, the combination involving the greatest number of entities shall be made. The experience of any entity used in such a combination shall not be used in combination with any other entity. The experience to be used in any combination for purposes of the Merit Rating Plan shall be subject to the provisions of the Rule 8, "Ownership Changes," of this section.

d) If an entity owns a majority interest in another entity which, in turn, owns the majority interest in another entity, all entities so related shall be considered as being under the same ownership for the purposes of this rule, regardless of the number of entities in succession.

8. Ownership Changes.

a) For purposes of this Plan a change in ownership includes any of the following:

   i) sale, transfer or conveyance of all or a portion of an entity's ownership interest.

   ii) sale, transfer or conveyance of an entity's physical assets to a purchasing entity which takes over the operation of the selling entity and wherein the selling entity

      a) becomes entirely inactive with no employees or

      b) retains a few employees for the purpose of closing out its affairs prior to dissolution as a legal entity or

      c) retains a few clerical employees for the purpose of carrying on operations in connection with investment of its financial assets.

iii)   merger or consolidation of two or more entities.

iv)    formation of a new entity subsequent to the dissolution or non-operative capacity of an entity

v)     voluntary or court-mandated establishment of a trustee or receiver, excluding a debtor in
       possession, a trustee under a revocable trust or franchiser.

b)    Continuation of Experience. Unless excluded under paragraph (c), the experience for any entity
      undergoing a change in ownership shall be transferred to the experience of the acquiring, surviving or
      new entity. The date of revision will be the later of the following two dates: 1) the effective date of the
      policy in effect at the time the PCRB receives a completed ERM-14 form outlining the ownership
      change or 2) the date on which the change in ownership occurred.

      i)   Partial Sale. If an entity disposes of a part of its assets or operations but otherwise continues to
           operate its business, all experience incurred prior to the sale shall be used in future Merit Rating
           Plan adjustments of the entity.

      Note: Future Merit Rating Plan adjustments of a risk shall retain all experience for any part of its
      operations which may have been discontinued or self-insured.

c)    Exclusion of Experience. The experience of any entity undergoing a change in ownership shall be
      retained and used in future Merit Rating Plan adjustments unless one or both of the following
      requirements (i) and (ii) are met at the same time of the ownership change.

      i)   A change in majority interest occurs, and the change in majority interest is accompanied by a
           complete change in operation and function sufficient to result in a change of governing
           classification, and the change in majority interest is accompanied by a change in the process and
           hazard of the operation.

      ii)  A change in majority interest occurs, and the change in majority interest is accompanied by a
           change in employees such that all or a substantial portion of the employees of the new ownership
           are not retained from the prior ownership.

d)    If the experience of an entity undergoing a change in ownership is to be excluded from future Merit
      Rating Plan adjustments for the entity, the Merit Rating Plan adjustment no longer applies as of the
      date of the ownership change unless the entity is acquired by another entity which has an existing
      Merit Rating Plan adjustment. In that case the Merit Rating Plan adjustments of the acquiring entity
      shall apply.

e)    Multiple Entities. When two entities under substantially the same ownership have been insured under a
      single policy and the ownership of one or both of them is changed so that there is no longer any
      connection between them, the merit rating procedure shall be as follows:

      i)   If the experience of the entities has been combined for merit rating purposes during the entire
           experience period, the experience incurred prior to the change shall not be used for future merit
           rating plan adjustment, unless

           a)    the insurance carrier or carriers request that a new Merit Rating Plan adjustment be
                 established, and

           b)    the PCRB is furnished with the experience required for the calculation of a Merit Rating
                 Plan adjustment submitted in an acceptance format.

      ii)  If the experience of the entities has been combined for less than two years at the time of the
           change, so that the experience for each entity is available during the period they were separately
           insured, the experience for each entity shall be used for the purpose of calculating a new Merit
           Rating Plan adjustment.

When three or more entities under substantially the same ownership have been insured under a single policy and the ownership of one of the entities has been changed so that there is no longer any connection between it and the remaining entities, the existing Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall continue to apply to the entities whose ownership has not changed. The entity whose ownership has changed shall not be subject to merit rating unless it has been purchased by an entity which has an applicable Merit Rating plan adjustment.

When three or more entries under substantially the same ownership have been insured under a single policy and the ownership of two or more of the entities has been changed so that common ownership is no longer present, the experience incurred prior to the date of the change shall not be used for future Merit Rating Plan adjustments, unless

a) the insurance carrier or carriers request that a new Merit Rating Plan adjustment be established, and

b) the PCRB is furnished with the experience required for the calculation of a Merit Rating Plan adjustment submitted in an acceptable format.

f) Employee Leasing. If (1) an entity terminates its employment relationship with all, or substantially all, its employees, and (2) all substantially all of such employees are thereafter employed by another entity which leases such employees to the original employer, the experience incurred prior to the termination of the original employment relationship shall be used in future merit rating plan adjustments of the second entity.

9. Joint Ventures. When two or more risks associate for the purpose of undertaking one or more projects as a joint venture, the premium for the operation involved shall not be subject to merit rating until such time as the joint venture qualifies in accordance with the provisions of Rule 1 of this section, subject, however, to the following conditions:

a) The contracts shall be awarded in the name of the associated risks as a joint venture.

b) The joint ventures shall share responsibility for and participate in the control, direction and supervision of all work undertaken.

c) The joint ventures shall maintain a common bank account, payroll and business records.

d) When the joint venture becomes subject to merit rating, all applicable Merit Rating Plan adjustments shall be based exclusively on the experience of the joint venture. The experience developed under a joint venture shall be excluded from the future Merit Rating Plan adjustments of the individual ventures.

## SECTION IV

### APPLICATION OF MERIT RATING PLAN ADJUSTMENT

1. Merit Rating Plan Adjustment. A Merit Rating Plan adjustment for a qualified risk shall be determined annually (except as provided in Rules 3 and 4 of this section) and shall be effective as of the RED of the risk. No more than one Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall apply to a risk at the same time. Subject to the exceptions noted below, the Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall be applied to the premium developed by the use of carrier rates in force on the effective date of the policy.

#### EXCEPTIONS:

a) Premiums Not Subject to the Merit Rating Plan:

   The following are not subject to the Merit Rating Plan:

   i) Expense constants

   ii) The policy minimum premium

   iii) Premium under the National Defense Projects Rating Plan

   iv) Premium under Rule 1 of the Atomic Energy Procedure

   v) The surcharge premium under Rule 2 of the Atomic Energy Procedure

   vi) Premium developed under Code 9740 – Terrorism

   vii) Premium developed under Code 9741 - Catastrophe (other than Certified Acts of Terrorism)

2. Period and Operations Affected. The Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall be effective for a period of 12 months (except as provided in Rules 3 and 4 of this section) and shall apply to all the operations of the risk, regardless of whether the current or any new operations are assigned to the same classifications as were used in establishing the Merit Rating Plan adjustment.

3. Single Policy Risk. If a risk is covered by a single policy, the following procedure shall apply:

   a) The Merit Rating Plan adjustment effective as of the RED shall apply for the full term of the policy which becomes effective on such date and also for the full term of any policy which becomes effective within three months after such date.

   b) If a policy is written for a period of one year but is extended for a period of not more than 16 days, the carrier rates and Merit Rating Plan adjustment in effect as of the original termination date shall remain in effect until the termination date of the extended policy. The carrier rates and Merit Rating Plan adjustment which would have become effective as of the RED shall apply for a period of one year from the effective date of the renewal policy.

   c) If a policy becomes effective on a date more than three months after the RED,

      i) the outstanding Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall apply to the new policy for the period corresponding to the unexpired term of the rating.

      ii) a new Merit Rating Plan adjustment then shall apply for the unexpired term of the outstanding policy.

iii) thereafter, a new Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall apply annually as of a new RED. The new
    RED shall be the date 12 months after the effective date of the new policy

4. Multiple Policy Risk. If a risk is covered by several policies (as provided in Rule 8. of Section III of this Plan)
   which differ as to inception dates, the following procedure shall apply:

   A single Merit Rating Plan adjustment shall be computed to be effective for a period of twelve months
   beginning on the RED to be established by the PCRB. The PCRB may, however, authorize the application of
   an existing Merit Rating Plan adjustment for a period not to exceed fifteen months or a new Merit Rating Plan
   adjustment for a period greater than three months and less than twelve months for the purpose of
   establishing a RED. Any policy effective prior to the new RED established by the PCRB shall be canceled as
   of such date and rewritten for a period of twelve months. Any policy effective subsequent to the new RED
   established by the PCRB shall be written to expire concurrently with the next ensuing RED or shall be
   canceled as of that date. Any policies subject to this rule which are extended beyond the new period of
   twelve months shall be subject to the provisions of Rules 3(b) and 3(c) of this section.

## SECTION V

### TABULATION OF EXPERIENCE

1. Experience Used for the Merit Rating Plan. The experience used for purposes of the Merit Rating Plan
shall be the individual risk experience valued at least three months prior to the RED and reported in
accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Workers' Compensation Statistical Plan. It shall include
voluntary compensation insurance but shall exclude maritime employments and employments under the
Federal Employees' Liability Act.

2. Merit Rating Plan Forms. To determine the Merit Rating Plan adjustment the prescribed experience shall be
tabulated by the PCRB on approved Merit Rating Plan forms.

3. Payrolls. The audited payrolls or other exposures for each classification for the experience period shall be
tabulated by policy years.

4. Losses. Incurred losses or claims reported for all policy periods considered in qualifying a risk for the Merit
Rating Plan shall be tabulated in the following manner:

   a) Claims having no indemnity benefit payment or case reserve for indemnity benefit payment shall be
   excluded from the experience tabulation for purposes of the Merit Rating Plan. Losses as reported
   (indemnity, medical and total) shall be shown for each policy year. Losses incurred shall be on a gross
   basis, before the application of the deductible when such coverage is provided.

   b) All claims not excluded from the experience tabulation for purposes of the Merit Rating Plan by virtue
   of sections (a) above shall be listed in the experience tabulation with the following information:

   - Policy number
   - Policy effective date
   - Claim number or number of claims
   - Indemnity loss amount
   - Date of loss

   All claims reported with Catastrophe Code No. 48 shall be excluded from merit rating calculations.

   All claims reported with Catastrophe Code No. 12 shall be excluded from merit rating calculations.

5. Moral Responsibility. No loss shall be excluded from the experience of a risk on the ground that the
employer was not morally responsible for the accident that caused such loss.

6. Revision of Losses. It shall not be permissible to revise values because of department or judicial decision or
because of developments in the nature of injury between two valuation dates. Provided, however, that

   a) in cases where loss values are included or excluded through mistake other than error of judgment

   b) where a claim is declared non-compensable (see note below)

   c) where the claimant or carrier has recovered in an action against a third party

   d) where a claim should have been reported with Catastrophe Code No. 48, or

e) where a claim or a portion of a claim is ruled or officially declared fraudulent, or

f) where a claim should have been reported with Catastrophe Code No. 12.

In the above circumstances, revised statistical report(s) are required to be submitted in accordance with the
approved Statistical Plan. When a change to a claim value due to the above circumstances is known to the
insurer with certainty within 48 months of the expiration of a Merit Rating Plan adjustment which included loss
values for that claim, such revised statistical report(s) shall be used to adjust that merit rating. Such
adjustments to merit ratings shall be made regardless of when the correction report(s) reflecting the cited
event(s) is/are submitted to or received by the PCRB.

Note: For purposes of this rule, the term "non-compensable" refers to:

i) an official ruling specifically holding that a claim is not entitled to benefits under the provisions
   of the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation or Occupational Disease Act.

ii) a case where no claim was filed during the period of limitation provided by the Pennsylvania
    Workers Compensation or Occupational Disease Act for the filing of such claim and the carrier therefore
    closes the case.

iii) a case where the carrier contends prior to the evaluation date that a claimant is not entitled to benefits
     under the Pennsylvania Workers Compensation or Occupational Disease Act and the claim is officially
     closed because of the claimant's failure to prosecute his claim.

### MERIT RATING PLAN PROCEDURE

1. Merit Rating Plan Adjustments. For each risk qualified under Section III of the Merit Rating Plan claims
   listed in the experience tabulation under Section V, Paragraph 4 of the Merit Rating Plan shall be counted.
   Merit Rating Plan adjustments shall apply based on the following criteria:

   a) No compensable employee lost-time injuries - 5 percent (5.0%) discount.

   b) One (1) compensable employee lost-time injury - No discount or surcharge.

   c) Two (2) or more compensable employee lost-time injuries - 5 percent (5.0%) surcharge. The PCRB will
      determine the appropriate Merit Rating Plan adjustment factors and notify the carrier.

### Pennsylvania and Delaware Premium Algorithm Preface:

The computation of workers compensation premium includes a broad complement of potential rating values, pricing programs and other similar or related variables. To the extent that these component parts of premium determination may be applied in a prescribed sequence and using defined formulas and/or relationships, several potential benefits arise including the following:

- Competitive differences within the marketplace can be more clearly defined and consistently applied;

- Similarly situated risks can receive comparable treatment with respect to specific rating values, pricing programs or other factors, increasing the equity of the marketplace;

- Analysis of the effects of various components of overall premium determination can be better understood and more intelligently compared across carriers, states and/or time;

- In the event that new pricing programs or other factors are introduced in the future, the defined existing formulas can provide a consistent basis for the development of programs and system procedures within the workers compensation industry.
